62|Composer ROWSPAN problem|Created by Jukka Santala (donwulff@iki.fi) on Tuesday, April 7, 1998 5:08:08 AM PDT NEWLINE Additional Details : NEWLINE Sometimes when the ROWSPAN attribute in a table has been NEWLINE set past the number of rows in a table, Composer will end NEWLINE up with memory corruption. This is due to a function using NEWLINE the number of rows to initialize an array. NEWLINE  NEWLINE In particular, the following HTML code will demonstrate: NEWLINE  NEWLINE <TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 WIDTH="100%"> NEWLINE <TR><TD BGCOLOR="#000000" VALIGN=TOP ROWSPAN=2> NEWLINE     <IMG SRC="images/mozilla-banner.jpg" NEWLINE     ALT="" BORDER=0 USEMAP="#banner" NEWLINE     WIDTH=600 HEIGHT=50 VSPACE=0 HSPACE=0> NEWLINE </TD></TR></TABLE> NEWLINE  NEWLINE From a netscape rep. suggested to use a re-sizable array. NEWLINE From personal view over the code, it seems that the extra NEWLINE array positions arne''t actually needed since the spanned NEWLINE rows don''t get visible, though, so ending the loop once NEWLINE the existing rows have been processed is another NEWLINE possibility. It''s also within possibility that the row NEWLINE counter method needs fixing; need to dig deeper into the NEWLINE code.

193|Non-Latin-1 strings in frameListmenu are not displayed properly|Created by Jungshik  Shin (jshin@pantheon.yale.edu) on Monday, April 13, 1998 4:19:32 PM PDT NEWLINE Additional Details : NEWLINE Open multiple browser windows and make each of them display NEWLINE web pages NEWLINE with non-Latin-1 strings as their titles. FrameList menu NEWLINE display NEWLINE titles of those pages in Compound text encoding. This is NEWLINE always the NEWLINE case in Communicator/Navigator up to 4.05. In Mozilla NEWLINE (19980331), NEWLINE it''s not consistently the case. For some pages, Frame List NEWLINE menu NEWLINE displays the title correctly while for other pages, Frame NEWLINE List menu NEWLINE displays the title in Compound text encoding. NEWLINE ns/cmd/xfe/src/FrameListmenu.cpp NEWLINE gets the title of the frame using NEWLINE XFE_Frame->getTitle().(defined in Frame.cpp). NEWLINE The way it returns the title of the frame is inconsistent. NEWLINE Sometimes, it NEWLINE returns it in locale-dependent encoding and othertimes it NEWLINE returns it NEWLINE in Compound Text encoding of Xlib. In the former case, a NEWLINE subsequent call NEWLINE to convert locale-dependent encoding to Compound String of NEWLINE Motif leads NEWLINE to the correct result while in the latter case, it doesn''t. NEWLINE Updated by Ramiro Estrugo (ramiro@netscape.com) on Friday, April 24, 1998 9:29:47 PM PDT NEWLINE Additional Details : NEWLINE Assigned to ramiro@netscape.com NEWLINE  NEWLINE I think we can fix this by not using XFE_Frame::getTitle() which as you indicate NEWLINE seems to be flaky. NEWLINE  NEWLINE Instead we can store the title when the back end calls XFE_SetDocTitle() and NEWLINE used that stored string in the frame. NEWLINE  NEWLINE So that when XFE_FrameListMenu iterates through the frames, it gets what the NEWLINE backend thinks should be the right thing for the title.  This we know will work, NEWLINE since titles for documents are not broken in the BE as far as we can tell.

217|Netscape Compile Error|Created by David Nebinger (dnebinger@synertech.highmark.com) on Tuesday, April 14, 1998 11:20:12 AM PDT NEWLINE Additional Details : NEWLINE Netscape compile fails on line #124 of NEWLINE ns/modules/libpref/src/prefapi.c.  Changing the line from: NEWLINE   XP_FREEIF((void*)he->key); NEWLINE to: NEWLINE   XP_FREEIF(he->key); NEWLINE  NEWLINE fixes the problem.  If other compilers complain about the NEWLINE missing typecast, potential resolution would be to create a NEWLINE new macro that takes the type as an argument.  Instead of NEWLINE using the macro: NEWLINE #define XP_FREEIF(obj) do { if(obj) { XP_FREE(obj); obj = 0; NEWLINE }} while(0) NEWLINE  NEWLINE try the macro: NEWLINE #define XP_FREEIFTYPE(obj,typ) do { if (obj) { XP_FREE(obj); NEWLINE obj = (typ)0;}} while(0) NEWLINE with line #124 as NEWLINE   XP_FREEIFTYPE(he->key,void*); NEWLINE  NEWLINE Thanks

235|PRNetAddr doesn't match sockaddr_in|Created by Bert Driehuis (driehuis@playbeing.org) on Wednesday, April 15, 1998 4:01:59 PM PDT NEWLINE Additional Details : NEWLINE Building Mozilla 1998-04-08 fails on BSD/OS 3.0. On NEWLINE investigation, the definition of PRNetAddr (which is cast NEWLINE into a sockaddr_in in ns/nsprpub/src/md/unix/unix.c in the NEWLINE MD_connect routine) turns out to use a short in host order NEWLINE for the sin_family field. BSD/OS 3.0 (and I'd imagine all NEWLINE 4.4lite2 derived unixes, but I haven't checked) define this NEWLINE field as NEWLINE 	u_char sa_len; NEWLINE 	u_char sa_family; NEWLINE which happens to be byte-swapped w.r.t. the assumptions in NEWLINE ns/nsprpub/include/prio.h, where these two bytes are NEWLINE addressed as one PRUint16. NEWLINE  NEWLINE This needs to be addressed, probably in NEWLINE ns/nsprpub/src/md/unix/unix.c, by filling in a sockaddr_in NEWLINE from the PRNetAddr structure, before performing the connect. NEWLINE  NEWLINE I haven't provided a fix, since I'm not positive about the NEWLINE proper way of fixing it. I'll see if I can come up with a NEWLINE solution that works with BSD/OS 3.0 without obviously NEWLINE breaking ports on which casting to sockaddr_in works.

271|Proxy user can't fetch RDF sitemap from rdf.netscape.com|Created by   (meltsner@hotmail.com) on Friday, April 24, 1998 8:06:15 AM PDT NEWLINE Additional Details : NEWLINE A minute or so after starting Mozilla, the system times out NEWLINE the retrieval of the sitemap (for NavCenter/Aurora, I NEWLINE believe) from rdf.netscape.com.  The proxy setting is NEWLINE probably being ignored.  Without looking at the code, I NEWLINE suspect it's fetching the info directly, rather than going NEWLINE through the standard NetLib method. NEWLINE  NEWLINE Both the Manual Proxy setting and the autoproxy.pac files NEWLINE are ignored. NEWLINE  NEWLINE There are other odd things happening around the proxy NEWLINE settings, but this is quite reproducible. NEWLINE Updated by   (meltsner@hotmail.com) on Wednesday, May 6, 1998 6:26:44 AM PDT NEWLINE Additional Details : NEWLINE It still happens with 4-29 release. NEWLINE  NEWLINE I suspect it's that the default NavCenter RDF file is fetched without looking at NEWLINE the proxy settings, or it could be the other problem I've noticed, which is that NEWLINE frequently the proxy settings don't seem to be read upon startup -- you have to NEWLINE change them back and forth to enable application proxy access.

293|Source redefines PI in dom/public/coreDom/nsIDOMNode.h|Created by Brian Grunkemeyer (bg2k@cmu.edu) on Sunday, May 3, 1998 2:02:32 AM PDT NEWLINE Additional Details : NEWLINE PI is used in an enum internally in NEWLINE dom/public/coreDom/nsIDOMNode.h.

I got around it by undefining PI in the NEWLINE file immediately before this, but that isn't the right thing NEWLINE to do either.  Change the name from PI to something other NEWLINE than a commonly used mathematical constant.  Besides, I have NEWLINE no idea what a "PI" node is from the name - it's a crappy NEWLINE name or abbreviation.

348|History display in Aurora appears to be bogus|Created by Ronan Waide (waider@waider.ie) on Tuesday, May 12, 1998 8:09:58 AM PDT NEWLINE Additional Details : NEWLINE History -> By Date seems to have totally scrambled dates. NEWLINE This may well be contributed to by the fact that I NEWLINE originally copied my entire .netscape directory into NEWLINE mozilla's feeding ground, however. NEWLINE  NEWLINE History -> By Site only has one page entry per site. NEWLINE  NEWLINE I'm looking at the date one at the moment. NEWLINE Updated by Ronan Waide (waider@waider.ie) on Tuesday, May 12, 1998 9:37:08 AM PDT NEWLINE Additional Details : NEWLINE Date munging appears to be a big-endian/little-endian problem - the datablock NEWLINE retrieved from the history db file is in sparc's natural byte order, but the NEWLINE COPY_INT32 seems to be expecting the opposite. Not really sure why thisis NEWLINE happening, though. NEWLINE Updated by Ronan Waide (waider@waider.ie) on Tuesday, May 12, 1998 10:22:05 AM PDT NEWLINE Additional Details : NEWLINE Okay, it looks like the problem is that Netscape 4.0 has the date field arranged NEWLINE one way, and RDF is expecting it to be the other. Aurora is opening NEWLINE ~/.netscape/history.db despite the fact that I'm using jwz's (HOME=~/.mozilla; NEWLINE mozilla) hack to avoid breaking my Netscape 4 stuff. NEWLINE  NEWLINE The one page per site seems to have been fixed in the meantime. I think I NEWLINE changed a type somewhere that might have fixed this. diff will sort it out. NEWLINE Updated by Ronan Waide (waider@waider.ie) on Tuesday, May 19, 1998 2:12:22 AM PDT NEWLINE Additional Details : NEWLINE Duh. It was looking in my ~/.netscape dir because prefs.js points there.

361|Fail to parse some PICS labels|Created by Paul Chek (pchek@ziplink.net) on Monday, May 18, 1998 12:39:24 PM PDT NEWLINE Additional Details : NEWLINE 1.The "extension" option must be the very first option in a NEWLINE PICS label for it to be parsed correctly. If it is preceded NEWLINE      by any of the other label options then the parse for NEWLINE the extension and the label fails. I tracked this down to NEWLINE the fact NEWLINE      that the single label object is closed when the NEWLINE processing for any option completes. The problem was in NEWLINE      CSLABEL.C, about line 245 in the table definition for NEWLINE SingleLabel_stateTokens element "option value". The next NEWLINE      to last specification containing the command was NEWLINE Command_CLOSE and it should be Command_NONE. NEWLINE    2.Multiple ratings in a single label are parsed without NEWLINE errors but the structures to iterate through the multiple NEWLINE single NEWLINE      labels are not set up correctly. This prevents Mozilla NEWLINE from creating standalone labels from a single label NEWLINE      containing multiple ratings. Creating standalone labels NEWLINE is needed for processing of signed labels. I found this in NEWLINE      the C reference code, not the Mozilla code, but Mozilla NEWLINE probably has the problem also. It does not affect the trust NEWLINE      label processing because that does not depend on the NEWLINE ability to iterate through the parsing structures. NEWLINE    8.If you have an extension option, the parser does not NEWLINE correctly finish the parse on the label when it sees the NEWLINE      closing paren after ratings. If you remove the NEWLINE extension option the parser detects the closing paren NEWLINE correctly and NEWLINE      returns _done status.

370|Cant parse PICS labels in HTTP headers - fix available|Created by Paul Chek (pchek@ziplink.net) on Monday, May 18, 1998 6:58:36 PM PDT NEWLINE Additional Details : NEWLINE  NEWLINE      CSParse_targetParser where I found: NEWLINE  NEWLINE      /* changed by montulli@netscape.com 11/29/97 NEWLINE  NEWLINE      * if (HTChunk_size(pCSParse->token)) { NEWLINE  NEWLINE      * HTChunk_terminate(pCSParse->token); NEWLINE  NEWLINE      * token = HTChunk_data(pCSParse->token); NEWLINE  NEWLINE      * } NEWLINE  NEWLINE      */ NEWLINE  NEWLINE      if(HTChunk_data(pCSParse->token)) NEWLINE  NEWLINE      { NEWLINE  NEWLINE      HTChunk_terminate(pCSParse->token); NEWLINE  NEWLINE      token = HTChunk_data(pCSParse->token); NEWLINE  NEWLINE      } NEWLINE  NEWLINE      At the closing paren for the label the call to NEWLINE HTChunk_data returns true and sets the token to an EMPTY NEWLINE      string with a size of 1. So the code winds through the NEWLINE parsing again, gets confused and throws an error. At NEWLINE      the same point HTChunk_size returns false, so a new NEWLINE EMPTY token is not set and it successfully parses the NEWLINE      PICS label. After restoring the original code the PICS NEWLINE label parses correctly in the HTTP header.
371|dead code and erroneous code in PICS label processing|Created by Paul Chek (pchek@ziplink.net) on Monday, May 18, 1998 7:00:39 PM PDT NEWLINE Additional Details : NEWLINE In PICAPI.C, function target_callback "if(target == NEWLINE CSLLTC_SINGLE)" will never be executed because the NEWLINE      variable cd is always 0 when. "(target == NEWLINE CSLLTC_SINGLE)". Furthermore, the test NEWLINE "if(lo->generic.state)" NEWLINE      is incorrect, it should be ‘if(BVal_value(&lo->generic) NEWLINE )".
372|user pref callback not called while processing user.js|Created by Paul Chek (pchek@ziplink.net) on Monday, May 18, 1998 7:02:54 PM PDT NEWLINE Additional Details : NEWLINE In NET_RegisterCookiePrefCallbacks when PREF_GetCharPref is NEWLINE called to get the name of the Java script NEWLINE      to use for filtering cookies NEWLINE "network.cookie.filterName" it returns NULL meaning it NEWLINE couldn’t find the NEWLINE      preference. This is despite the fact that it is in NEWLINE prefs.js and liprefs.js was removed. When I looked into this NEWLINE I NEWLINE      found that when the user preference scripts are NEWLINE processed by pref_OpenFile it calls NEWLINE      PREF_EvaluateConfigScript with bCallbacks equal FALSE. NEWLINE This keeps NET_CookieBehaviorPrefChanged NEWLINE      and NET_CookieScriptPrefChanged from being called to NEWLINE record the changed user preference. If I change NEWLINE      bCallbacks to TRUE then the callback functions are NEWLINE called and preferences work as designed. The current NEWLINE      work around is to call PREF_GetIntPref instead of NEWLINE relying on the saved state of the preference, which is set NEWLINE      by the callback.

NEWLINE  NEWLINE Unfortunately, different sections of code in various spots in RDF would mark NEWLINE things differently... for example, Bookmark code would say that the NEWLINE RDF_FirstVisitDate entry was a "Numeric Date String" while History code would say NEWLINE that the RDF_FirstVisitDate entry was a "Numeric Date" (not a String). NEWLINE  NEWLINE So, that's bad.  The "right thing" to do, which I've just done, is to have every NEWLINE section of code in RDF use the same representation of dates... I chose STRINGs.

NEWLINE  NEWLINE The version of Netscape being used is Navigator Gold 3.01. NEWLINE Updated by Patrick Pollet (Patrick.pollet@insa-lyon.fr) on Thursday, July 2, 1998 9:51:11 AM PDT NEWLINE Additional Details : NEWLINE Hi, NEWLINE   Never had it with Netscape 3.01 Gold. BUT NEWLINE  NEWLINE   I am getting a similar problem with communicator 4.05 Fr NEWLINE and the new release (4.05 english with JDK 1.1 support). NEWLINE  NEWLINE   Communicator is installed in a Netware file server and is NEWLINE launched by Netware Application Launcher . Makes no difference NEWLINE actually. I get the same when double-clicking on the EXE file. NEWLINE  NEWLINE   This GPF happens BEFORE the splash screen shows up. Thus it is NEWLINE not a problem of cache or bad netscape.hst or bad user prefs NEWLINE as I have red in NUGIES. NEWLINE  NEWLINE   If I just ignore the Windows dialog Box , Communicator DO load NEWLINE and run properly. I can then close the GPF dialog box,after Communictaor NEWLINE is fully loaded, and it keeps running ... and is functionnal... NEWLINE  NEWLINE   It looks like a GPF in a "side thread" launched at startup. NEWLINE I did try to use a lower screen resolution (down to 640*349 * 16 colors) NEWLINE since I initially though it was a problem with the video drivers NEWLINE (S2 trio V3), but no difference. NEWLINE  NEWLINE   This error only happens the first time a user launch Communicator NEWLINE after logging in. The second run is OK... but if we stops the PC or NEWLINE simply logout-login, we get the very same GPF at the first run !!! NEWLINE   It tried Dr Watson, but I never got any message. I tried to NEWLINE launch a DLL spy program, but I never found any extra DLL in memory NEWLINE whether I got or not the GPF... NEWLINE  NEWLINE   I noticed that the mouse cursor always stays as "hour glass" ,until I NEWLINE press the mouse button, whether I get or not the GPF. NEWLINE  NEWLINE    If I simply copy the Communicator directory on the local disk (or install NEWLINE it there), I never get the problem... NEWLINE  NEWLINE    Looks like Windows is " getting impatient" about Communicator NEWLINE showing up and try to kill it ... why ? NEWLINE  NEWLINE  NEWLINE  NEWLINE Here is what I get on a 16Mb RAM PC ( win 95B, with kernel update NEWLINE and service pack 1).

452|user entries in LOCAL_MACHINE instead of CURRENT_USER|Created by   (fprefect@schiller.big.ac.at) on Tuesday, June 16, 1998 12:28:40 PM PDT NEWLINE Additional Details : NEWLINE I installed a windows NT network here, with one server and 4 NEWLINE clients. NEWLINE After installing netscape I noticed that netscape stores the NEWLINE specific user information under the LOCAL_MACHINE key in the NEWLINE registry. NEWLINE Since only the CURRENT_USER key gets saved per user this NEWLINE leads to some problems. NEWLINE For example: user x saves the profile under U:\\profiles NEWLINE u: being the mounted user-directory from the server. NEWLINE Now he logs out and another user starts netscape. NEWLINE Since he doesnt have u:\\profiles on his u: drive netscpae NEWLINE asks him to create a profile. He does it..and everything NEWLINE works. But this way you get a pretty large number of NEWLINE profiles on one machine and the worst part is, when the user NEWLINE goes to another machine he has to do it again. NEWLINE  NEWLINE A workaround is to tell the users to create a profile with a NEWLINE special name "default" and store it under u:\\netscape. So NEWLINE netscape looks for it on the network drive and finds it. NEWLINE But that way it is impossible for a user to have more than NEWLINE one profile for himself.

466|"font stacks" and a parsing algorithm bug|Created by Jared Momose (jmomose@casefinder.com) on Tuesday, June 30, 1998 2:30:24 PM PDT NEWLINE Additional Details : NEWLINE There is not a separate section for "logical" bugs, so Ill NEWLINE present my case in this section. NEWLINE  NEWLINE This bug is deals with text and attribute changing when a NEWLINE document is displayed on a screen. NEWLINE  NEWLINE From what I have seen, when Netscape loads and displays NEWLINE documents on the screen, it sets up a "Font Stack" to do its NEWLINE attribute changing.  Say you change the current text in a NEWLINE document to bold; Netscape pushes the current font onto a NEWLINE stack and uses that font + bold for the new font.  The NEWLINE problem comes when you have a line like the following. NEWLINE  NEWLINE text <B> text <I> text </B> text </I> text NEWLINE  NEWLINE When the </B> tag appears, the font stack is popped, and a NEWLINE previous font is retrieved.  However, this previous font NEWLINE does not have bold turned off, but rather has italics turned NEWLINE off!  If you are following me, take it one step further. NEWLINE Try putting a <FONT COLOR="#mycolor"> in the above html line NEWLINE and modifying it such that a different attribute is turned NEWLINE off before the color is. NEWLINE  NEWLINE Another question arises: "who would do such a thing as NEWLINE overlap font attributes?".  Well....me! NEWLINE  NEWLINE I would love to hear some input from mozilla developers, NEWLINE especially reasons *why* this "Font Stack" was implemented NEWLINE into the browser. (Am I missing something?  Is it faster NEWLINE than other techniques for formatting and displaying a doc? NEWLINE Easier?) NEWLINE  NEWLINE Jared Momose. NEWLINE Geronimo Developement Corp.

487|Multi-threading?|Created by Rick Downes (mozilla@radsoft.net) on Thursday, July 16, 1998 6:15:35 AM PDT NEWLINE Additional Details : NEWLINE Seems you guys haven't really gotten multithreading. NEWLINE Nowadays you've got so much going on in this mutating app NEWLINE that even at exit there are threads running, accessing NEWLINE things which other threads do their politest to clean up NEWLINE and destroy. NEWLINE With all these threads running you must find a way of NEWLINE synchronising the ExitProcess call, either directly or NEWLINE indirectly, by waiting on all running threads to exit, NEWLINE signalling them first of the shutdown. NEWLINE Several times your app has actually been running in the NEWLINE background, totally invisible, several seconds realtime NEWLINE after it disappeared from the screen. NEWLINE In this case if it is opened again, one of three things can NEWLINE result (so far): NEWLINE 1.) It just doesn't open. Period. NEWLINE 2.) It opens and disappears just as fast - like a flash on NEWLINE the screen. NEWLINE 3.) (Most often) - it crashes ALL OVER THE PLACE. These NEWLINE successive crashes, caused by the structured exception NEWLINE handling, show something is DIRELY wrong, A.) You have no NEWLINE build-in handler at all, B.) some thread is accessing NEWLINE something which has been removed from you process page NEWLINE tables subsequent to the DestroyWindow and its follow-ups. NEWLINE Updated by Garrett Arch Blythe (blythe@netscape.com) on Tuesday, July 21, 1998 2:48:12 PM PDT NEWLINE Additional Details : NEWLINE Yes, this sucks.
488|Mnemonics with form listboxes|Created by Rick Downes (mozilla@radsoft.net) on Thursday, July 16, 1998 6:18:26 AM PDT NEWLINE Additional Details : NEWLINE The mnemonmics with form listboxes and comboboxes, so NEWLINE necessary and funtional with Netscape 3 are gone. Hitting a NEWLINE keyboard key will not give ordinary Windows functionality, NEWLINE i.e. hitting a 'r' will scroll to the beginning of the r's NEWLINE in the list, etc. This is VERY unfortunate! (In your VM?) NEWLINE Updated by Garrett Arch Blythe (blythe@netscape.com) on Tuesday, July 21, 1998 2:52:47 PM PDT NEWLINE Additional Details : NEWLINE Dan, this is possibly a forms bug though the "correct" behavior is never NEWLINE specified in the report other than "be like NS version 3.0". NEWLINE  NEWLINE Rick may impossibly be talking about some 4.X Java AWT problem (the mention of a NEWLINE VM makes me think this).  More info may be needed, so Rick please be more NEWLINE specific if you are listening in. NEWLINE  NEWLINE  NEWLINE Terry, I'm actually assigning to you.  I can't seem to assign bugs to NEWLINE danm@netscape.com who needs to handle this.

490|[Dogfood] Editor needs to insert formatting whitespace|Created by Klaus Malorny (Klaus.Malorny@knipp.de) on Thursday, July 16, 1998 11:39:10 AM PDT NEWLINE Additional Details : NEWLINE  NEWLINE The Composer creates '\\n<BR>' for line breaks, e.g. NEWLINE entering NEWLINE  NEWLINE Hello World! (RETURN) NEWLINE How are you today? (RETURN) NEWLINE  NEWLINE generates NEWLINE ... NEWLINE <BODY> NEWLINE Hello World! NEWLINE <BR>How Are You Today NEWLINE <BR>&nbsp; NEWLINE ... NEWLINE  NEWLINE The Linefeed before the <BR> tag creates additional NEWLINE white space, which is anoying in several circumstances NEWLINE (eg. you set the font size of the line to size=-2, then the NEWLINE '\\n' produces a white space of size=0, which changes the NEWLINE line height). A better solution would be '<BR>\\n', since NEWLINE whitespace is removed after a <BR>. NEWLINE  NEWLINE You should review the following code for that: NEWLINE lib/layout/edtele.cpp, lines 6842, Method NEWLINE void CEditContainerElement::PrintOpen( CPrintState NEWLINE *pPrintState )
491|Some Makefiles use $(CCC) to link executables|Created by   (Randy.Austin@digital.com) on Friday, July 17, 1998 11:01:10 AM PDT NEWLINE Additional Details : NEWLINE  NEWLINE The three Makefiles NEWLINE   xpcom/tests/Makefile NEWLINE   nsprpub/lib/prstreams/tests/testprstrm/Makefile NEWLINE   network/module/tests/Makefile NEWLINE  NEWLINE link executables via $(CCC). NEWLINE  NEWLINE On Digital UNIX, CCC includes the "-x cxx" option, which NEWLINE does not understand that .so files are not cxx files (it NEWLINE does understand .o and .a files). Therefore those makefiles NEWLINE fail on Digital UNIX. NEWLINE  NEWLINE My quick fix after finding the first one was to find the NEWLINE rest and to add "-x none" to the "$(CCC) -o" command. NEWLINE However modifying the Makefiles to use the save targets that NEWLINE all other Makefiles use is the correct fix.
492|Multiple ALIGN="LEFT" tables don't render|Created by Michiel Trimpe (mtrimpe@dse.nl) on Friday, July 17, 1998 2:34:54 PM PDT NEWLINE Additional Details : NEWLINE IF you have two tables, both align=left , the one that's on NEWLINE the left, (the first one in the HTML code) renders only as NEWLINE far as the second table's height.

NEWLINE  NEWLINE I wrote a patch (it is derived from the patch by Dan McGuirk NEWLINE <djm@indirect.com>) that adds a new run-time option NEWLINE -configdir <directory> that allows to specify a config NEWLINE subdirectory different from ".netscape" and also allows to NEWLINE change the compiled in default by changing one line of the NEWLINE ocode instead of hunting for all these hardcoded strings NEWLINE through all the sources. NEWLINE  NEWLINE I am trying to keep the patch up-to-date with the current NEWLINE CVS sources and you should always be able to find them NEWLINE (divided into files according to modules) at NEWLINE ftp://ftp.cs.cornell.edu/pub/nogin/mozilla/
532|CViewerSecurity dialog doesn't save info properly.|Created by   (shaman@nlc.net.au) on Friday, August 21, 1998 7:39:49 PM PDT NEWLINE Additional Details : NEWLINE When I click on a file that is opened by an external NEWLINE program and select "open it" as well as "don't show this NEWLINE again", it works for that instance of the program, but it NEWLINE forgets it the next time I load communicator.
533|Java applets force focus to it's parent window.|Created by   (shaman@nlc.net.au) on Friday, August 21, 1998 7:43:42 PM PDT NEWLINE Additional Details : NEWLINE When applets finish loading, they force the focus to their NEWLINE parent page. This is increadibly annoying, and is downright NEWLINE dangerous. There have been several instances when I've tried NEWLINE to click on a link the instant before a Java applet switched NEWLINE to another navigator window, where my click resulted in a NEWLINE completely different effect. I have to turn Java off, NEWLINE because when I open 5-10 news sites, they visibly 'flicker' NEWLINE as the focus jumps from one window to another.
534|Saving bookmarks corrupts dir ownership|Created by Doug Schaapveld (djschaap@eng.iastate.edu) on Wednesday, August 26, 1998 7:29:27 AM PDT NEWLINE Additional Details : NEWLINE On IRIX 6.2/6.3, saving the bookmarks file as (for example) NEWLINE /home/djschaap results in the owner of /home/djschaap being NEWLINE changed to 270614016 and group being changed to 9857420 NEWLINE (obviously not correct).  Admin must then go in & reset NEWLINE directory permissions for the affected users.  This appears NEWLINE to occur with NIS and local users, NFS and local home NEWLINE directories.  This "feature" has been around since at lest NEWLINE Navigator 4.02.  Under Linux, the same process will save the NEWLINE bookmarks in a file called -0nnnnn in the specified NEWLINE directory, where nnnnn is the PID of the mozilla/netscape NEWLINE process.  This appears to be the "correct" behavior in this NEWLINE case.
535|Can't do a MOZ_LITE build|It's not possible to do a MOZ_LITE build from the original 28th July 1998 NEWLINE Mozilla tarball. Yes, I know the recommended default is to do a MOZ_MEDIUM NEWLINE build, but some of us don't want Composer eating RAM thank you :-) NEWLINE  NEWLINE I managed to do a MOZ_LITE build on HP-UX by changing NEWLINE lib/layout/Makefile by moving the following CSRCS source files NEWLINE outside of the ifdef EDITOR section and into the main NEWLINE section: NEWLINE  NEWLINE layfree.c, layimage.c, layout.c, laysel.c, laytable.c, NEWLINE laytags.c, laytext.c, layutil.c NEWLINE  NEWLINE (in other words, the only thing left in the CSRCS += line NEWLINE inside ifdef EDITOR was layedit.c and $(NULL)) NEWLINE  NEWLINE The other change I had to make was to cmd/xfe/src/FindDialog.cpp. NEWLINE None of the EDT_* functions should be called when doing a MOZ_LITE build. NEWLINE Unfortunately, fe_replace_db() calls EDT_ReplaceText(), so NEWLINE #ifdef EDITOR was put around the whole fe_replace_db() function. This, of NEWLINE course, meant that #ifdef EDITOR was needed around the code that called this NEWLINE function too. Line 498 onwards of FindDialog.cpp now reads: NEWLINE  NEWLINE #ifdef EDITOR NEWLINE   if (replaceP) NEWLINE   { NEWLINE ... NEWLINE down to line 550: NEWLINE ... NEWLINE   else  // not replaceP NEWLINE #endif NEWLINE   { NEWLINE       XtVaSetValues (find_text, NEWLINE ... NEWLINE  NEWLINE One final note - is it wise to use the environmental variable NEWLINE EDITOR in the various Mozilla Makefiles to determine if NEWLINE Composer is built ? EDITOR is a standard UNIX env. var. to NEWLINE indicate your default text editor and is often defined in a NEWLINE user's environment ! It means that you have to remember to NEWLINE unset EDITOR prior to any MOZ_LITE build...ho hum... NEWLINE  NEWLINE Note that I've fixed this (and other problems under HP-UX) via NEWLINE a patch available here: NEWLINE http://hpux.csc.liv.ac.uk/hppd/mozilla/mozpatch-5.00.tar.gz NEWLINE (this contains a file mozilla.patch, which is the context diffs for NEWLINE all HP-UX problems to date - documentation on the changes in the patch NEWLINE are in the HPUX.Install file)
536|Error if Mozilla started off-line|When starting up off-line (i.e. no Net connection, including no DNS), NEWLINE  Mozilla pops up a warning: NEWLINE  "A network error occurred: unable to connect to server NEWLINE   (TCP Error: XP_GetBuiltinString: 4420 not found) NEWLINE   The server may be down or unreachable" NEWLINE  However, it's then quite happy to surf a Web server running on the localhost. NEWLINE  Looking at modules/rdf/src/ht.c and modules/rdf/src/rdfht.c, it would appear NEWLINE  that Mozilla bizarrely attempts to access this URL by default whenever it NEWLINE  starts: http://rdf.netscape.com/rdf/navcntr.rdf NEWLINE  NEWLINE This isn't good if you're not connected to the Net at the time ! Surely a NEWLINE local copy of this should be used and perhaps update this local copy when NEWLINE you're next connected to the Net "live" (assuming you can tell if you're NEWLINE online vs. offline), so that when you're next offline, it'll have an NEWLINE up-to-date local copy of the RDF file to use.
537|Can't close View->Page Source or View->Page Info windows|There is no button or pull-down menu to close either the NEWLINE View->Page Source or View->Page Info windows. The keyboard short-cut NEWLINE ALT-W, which used to work in Netscape 3.X, no longer works in Netscape 4.X NEWLINE or any version of Mozilla. In exasperation (after getting a lot of source/info NEWLINE windows left around in a session !), I eventually had to reconfigure my NEWLINE window manager to support "Kill Window", but it's an inconvenient NEWLINE way to close the offending windows. Not sure if this applies to HP-UX only, but NEWLINE it's annoying enough to stop me using Netscape 4.X or Mozilla ! NEWLINE  NEWLINE BTW, I can't search the View->Page Source window, which is maddening ! NEWLINE The PC version can do this (with a bit of trickery...it's non-obvious on that NEWLINE platform though), but the UNIX one can't ! I end up having to save the HTML NEWLINE source to a file and grep'ing it (for links, tags etc), which is ridiculous.
538|Bugzilla can't search bug lists for a text match|Bugzilla currently has no way to type in a word or phrase and have it NEWLINE come back with a list of bugs that match that word/phrase. Without this NEWLINE facility, it meant that I've duplicate-reported some bugs by mistake, NEWLINE without realising they'd already been reported. NEWLINE  NEWLINE To save on CPU cycles, perhaps only the Summary line needs to be searched, NEWLINE rather than the Description body ? NEWLINE  NEWLINE Also, when submitting a bug, there appears to be no mechanism to avoid NEWLINE (or at least warning about the possibility of) duplicate bug reports. NEWLINE Perhaps a keyword system or something would have to be used - if your bug NEWLINE report matches keywords, list those matching bug reports (allowing the user to NEWLINE check them out) as a warning before accepting a new bug report. Or maybe NEWLINE you folks could figure something out better than this, I dunno NEWLINE  NEWLINE BTW, why are there no "Bugzilla components" ? I'm forced to choose a component NEWLINE when reporting this bug, but they all look like Mozilla components to me !
539|enter_bug.cgi chokes if we have multiple products.|It gets the version and component field wrong, and therefore the default NEWLINE assigned-to field wrong.  Oops! NEWLINE  NEWLINE Hopefully, people will manually assign Bugzilla bugs to terry@mozilla.org until NEWLINE I get this fixed.

543|Bug list should not be titled "Mozilla bug list"|When I asked to give me a list of all Bugzilla bugs in Bugzilla, NEWLINE buglist.cgi gave me a list titled "Mozilla bug list". I think NEWLINE you should drop "Mozilla" from the title
7195|UMR in xptcall|reassigning to roger.
545|There should be a way to enter a version number for "other"|It would be nice if you could add some extra possible values to the "Version" NEWLINE field. NEWLINE I would suggest adding: NEWLINE    - A "CVS image" with an extra field for the date/time of the last "cvs NEWLINE update" NEWLINE    - An extra text field for the "Other" choice NEWLINE    - An "Unknown" (with no extra fields).
546|Adding "CC" field does not work|When type any address (no matter, mine or some other) to the CC field and press NEWLINE "Commit", I get an error message.

547|TextFields in Java are to "small" for Fonts|On Windows & Macintosh a TextField which is 20 Pixel height, is enough for a 12 NEWLINE Pixel Font. With X-Windows (HP/UX, AIX, anything !) the TextField must be 30 NEWLINE Pixel in height, else only 2 Pixels of the 12 Pixel-Font are visible. NEWLINE It seems the Insets of TextFields for X-Windows is much to big !? NEWLINE At the moment i must use System.getProperty("os.name"); to "fix" this bug, but NEWLINE this is not 100% Pure Java !
548|Restore the "show my bugs" from the old Bugzilla|The old Bugzilla had a nice feature - it had a link on the query page that NEWLINE allowed to see all "my" bugs (including those where I added myself to the CC NEWLINE list). It would be nice to have something similar in the new Bugzilla. A NEWLINE reasonable choice may be to add a checkbox to the query form with effect of NEWLINE showing only those bugs that have my e-mail somewhere (in CC list, in NEWLINE Description field - anywhere).

555|Need a version-numbering scheme for bugzilla source.|I think I should introduce a version number in the bugzilla source, and NEWLINE make tarballs. NEWLINE  NEWLINE My current thoughts are: NEWLINE  NEWLINE - Create a file called "version.tcl", which contains simply a line like NEWLINE             set versionnumber "1.4" NEWLINE  NEWLINE - Make the version number appear in the header or something. NEWLINE  NEWLINE - Whenever I feel it's time to spin a new tarball, I'll up the version number, NEWLINE   create the tarball, and then UP THE NUMBER AGAIN.  That way, the running NEWLINE   version will always have a different version number than the one in the NEWLINE   tarball.  So, I can still check in changes whenever I feel like it, and not NEWLINE   worry that my thing is different than something out there wrapped in a NEWLINE   tarball.

562|Mozilla doesn't redraw properly when Raptor is running.|The toolbars and such of Mozilla wouldn't redraw properly while Raptor was NEWLINE running.  When I killed Raptor and refreshed Mozilla everything worked fine NEWLINE again.  The promised lack of interaction appears to be broken somehow. NEWLINE  NEWLINE I'm doing this on an HP Omnibook 800CT with a 7/1 version of Mozilla. NEWLINE  NEWLINE I also just noticed that the little titles under my desktop icons had the same NEWLINE problem when they got covered over by Raptor.  Perhaps it's not forwarding a NEWLINE message to invalidate screen areas after it gives them up?

579|{feature} CSS First-letter selector isn't finished|See URL given for sample HTML and test case. Again (similar to 311767) I expect NEWLINE we don't have the api yet in the content model, but ultimately it's a style NEWLINE thing.

581|CSS "must have" fonts cursive and fantasy aren't supported|In order to comply with CSS1, we need to support "Cursive" and "Fantasy" fonts. NEWLINE  NEWLINE See URL for test case and sample code. Is this a libfont issue (does raptor use NEWLINE libfont)? If so, please reassign to dp.

NEWLINE <P class="five"> NEWLINE I should be monospace. NEWLINE </P> NEWLINE </div> NEWLINE </body> NEWLINE  NEWLINE Note if you replace "monospace" with "sans-serif," it works, so I think it has NEWLINE something to do with the monospace font in particular.
583|Oblique font style not supported|I think we're supposed to treat it like italics. See URL for test case and NEWLINE sample code.
584|Small-caps font variant not supported|See URL for test case and sample code. Again, not sure if this is a libfont NEWLINE thing or a style thing...
585|line-height property not supported|See URL for test case and sample code. line-height is a CSS property to control NEWLINE the vertical space between lines of text.

588|{feature} [TEXT] Full justification of text doesn't work|We don't support justified text yet. Does this fit in with the whitespace work? NEWLINE It's also a style issue. See URL for test case and sample code.
589|Mixed style lists aren't counted properly|When you have mixed style list items, they don't work right. Sample code: NEWLINE <head> NEWLINE <style type="text/css"> NEWLINE .letters {list-style-type: upper-alpha;} NEWLINE .numbers {list-style-type: decimal;} NEWLINE </style> NEWLINE </head> NEWLINE <body> NEWLINE <OL class="letters"> NEWLINE <LI>This list should feature... NEWLINE <LI>...letters for each item... NEWLINE <LI class="numbers">...except this one. NEWLINE </OL> NEWLINE </body> NEWLINE  NEWLINE How it should appear: NEWLINE A. This list should feature... NEWLINE B. ... leters for each item... NEWLINE 3. ... except this one NEWLINE  NEWLINE Instead the third item shows up as "2." not "3." like this: NEWLINE 2. ... except this one
590|List items don't support images as bullets|See URL for test case and sample code. I'm guessing that kipp is the right NEWLINE person to update the LI element to handle images for bullets, and peterl can NEWLINE hook up style to this.
591|top border is one pixel too short horizontally|See URL for test case and sample code. The problem looks like this (with a thick NEWLINE top border): NEWLINE  NEWLINE ------ NEWLINE ------- NEWLINE \| foo \| NEWLINE -------

597|PageDown/PageUp key presses should scroll document|Not sure if this is a joki thing or not, but it would be nice if pressing pgdn NEWLINE and pgup scrolled the document.
598|Raptor hangs at www.cbs.com|Type in www.cbs.com, hit return, hangs immediately.
599|ss:FTP directories not displaying|ftp://ftp.netscape.com/pub doesn't show up, neither does a http directory, like NEWLINE http://slip/projects/test/install
600|No UI so can't authenticate with username/password|Can't get in to something like your e*trade account because you can't put in NEWLINE your username/password. Note: putting it in the url bar doesn't work either NEWLINE (does work in 4.06) so no workaround.
601|some GIF images are always dithering to 8bit color cube|This page has an example of GIF images with gray in them; these and other such NEWLINE images look bad in NGLayout. Photographic images, however, look rather good. The NEWLINE issue is that we sometimes assume 8bit when we actually might have a more NEWLINE capable display.
602|Frames "marginwidth" and "marginheight" not implemented yet|We should pass on the values of these attributes to the individual frame NEWLINE documents and have them treat it properly. Currently, the framed documents are NEWLINE assuming the standard 10 pixel over, 10 pixel down margins.
603|script src= doesn't work|See URL for test case and sample code. Most likely a known issue, but putting NEWLINE it into bugsplat anyway.
604|Viewer Crashes in form element|Viewer crashes when a form control gets focus and the document is switched. NEWLINE Can be reproduced by viewing test8 clicking inside a text field and then NEWLINE switching documents. Any fix should also be tested by viewing test9 (frameset NEWLINE test) and then switching to test1.
605|text appears in wrong place in doc|There is an <EMBED> of a quicktime movie, and to the *right* of it, the word NEWLINE "Alice" should appear. In Raptor it appears to the left of the plugin.
606|align=middle broken|the vertical alignment code needs fixing; align=middle is busted.
607|frameborder & border not yet implemented in <frameset>|<frameset border=.. frameborder=..> not yet implemented. www.stocksite.com NEWLINE is a good test case to use.
608|not implemented - frame borders responsive to mouse|The user cannot drag a frame border and have the frames resize.
609|Links don't work due to new selection code|Links have stopped working based on an if statement in some new selection code.
610|Editor mode and JS console need to move out of debug-only code|In the last revisions of webshell/browser window the hook up of editor mode and NEWLINE JS console to their menu items was moved to debug only code.  They need to move NEWLINE back.
611|Clicking on links do not work.|This is too old to be useful.
612|Selection cursor appears when clicking on a link|This is too old to be useful (selection has been completely reworked)
613|ss:hitting submit button causes re-entrancy crash|I put a hack into nsPresShell.cpp that sidesteps the bug for the NEWLINE stability release; a larger fix is really needed that involves event NEWLINE handling and widgets...
614|when window is scrolled, resize causes widgets to go nuts|i introduced this and have a fix.
615|unpainted region at bottom of window|if the page is too tall to fit in the window (so it needs to be scrolled), NEWLINE clicking outside of the thumb area until the thumb reaches the bottom of the NEWLINE scrollbar will leave you with the bottom part of the window unpainted. i have a NEWLINE fix for this.
616|Crash in nsTextContent - deleting a stack varible|This is too old to be useful (the ode has been completely reworked)
617|Crash in Dispatch event when switch documents|This happends (on Wndows) because a focus event is coming through when the NEWLINE window has already been deleted. I think the best fix for now is to just disable NEWLINE the notification of focus events, these notifications are not currently being NEWLINE used. The fix is will be in nsWindow.cpp
618|row background painting not backwards compatible|today we paint row backgrounds as a solid block, with cell backgrounds painting NEWLINE over them. NEWLINE Nav4 and IE treat row backgrounds as being inherited by the cells. NEWLINE The visual difference is the space between cells gets the table background NEWLINE rather than the row background. NEWLINE CSS-2 seems to indicate we should do it the way we're doing it today. NEWLINE I've added code to do this the Nav4 way, making sample 3 look correct. NEWLINE We can easily add variant code to check which mode we're in and do the correct NEWLINE thing.
619|table layout broken with nscoord-width columns and colspans|whenever we have colspans, we have a rule that the space required by the NEWLINE spanning cell is proportionately distributed to the column it spans, with the NEWLINE percentage based on the required width of the columns as if colspans didn't NEWLINE exist.  This rule has an exception:  whenever the widths of all the columns NEWLINE involved are specified, the specified widths are used and the proportions are NEWLINE never computed.
620|images with no width attribute in tables don't work well|whenever we have an image that doesn't have a specified width, and that image NEWLINE is inside a table, the table will lay out incorrectly.  This is because we are NEWLINE not computing the minimum required size of the cell containing the image NEWLINE correctly during the incremental reflow that is generated once the image width NEWLINE is known.
621|a document that ends in text doesn't layout properly|When you resize the window then it fixes it up. NEWLINE  NEWLINE It's because the flushing of text when closing the document isn't NEWLINE trigger an appended reflow like it should.
622|propagation error for tables|backward propagation was not terminating at "gating" tags, such as <table>. NEWLINE This would cause content to be ejected from the table when a <tr> was omitted NEWLINE and the table was inside another container, such as a nested table or a table NEWLINE inside a <div>.
623|table assertion triggered when maxElementSize > desiredSize|a floating image on this page reports its desired size to be less than its NEWLINE maxElementSize.  Table code asserts that maxElementSize <= desiredSize.  I've NEWLINE fixed it so that the table cell always reserves at least the maxElementSize for NEWLINE the content.

636|too much vertical space in table cells|Minor display problem. NEWLINE It looks like we're doing the "right" thing based on the content, but it's not NEWLINE what Nav4 does.

644|Checking on named anchors (#foo) in page forces reload|Let's say you're on a page, such as: NEWLINE http://warp/java/oji/index.html NEWLINE  NEWLINE And you click on the "What's New" link, whose URL is: NEWLINE http://warp/java/oji/index.html#new NEWLINE  NEWLINE It should just scroll you down to the location of that anchor (#new), but NEWLINE instead, it reloads the page before scrolling down to the named anchor.
645|Crash in dom/js when clicking on links with js in framesets|Jevering, you had a site you get this repeatedly on right?  I just have a local NEWLINE test case.  I want to get it into the bug report so I can verify on tip and NEWLINE branch.
646|<noscript> tag not respected|we should not display any document content within the <noscript> tag when NEWLINE javascript is enabled.  we should probably handle this like we would a comment, NEWLINE so we can recreate the original HTML if necessary (like an editor would need to)
647|mismatched style tags in nested tables closes outer table prematurely|this is a minimized test case derived from http://www.dogpile.com.  Interesting NEWLINE behaviors: NEWLINE 1. if the begin/end tags inside the inner table are matched correctly, the table NEWLINE lays out correctly. NEWLINE 2. if the tags are left mismatched, but the outer <center> tag is removed, the NEWLINE table lays out correctly.

NEWLINE  NEWLINE test case: NEWLINE =============================== NEWLINE <HTML><BODY> NEWLINE <FONT color=000000> NEWLINE <p>too NEWLINE <P>short! NEWLINE </FONT> NEWLINE <p>just NEWLINE <P>right! NEWLINE </BODY></HTML>
649|vertical centering|To center a table cell horizontally and vertically, I often use an approach like NEWLINE what you see at http://checkmate/aol/ -- we don't NEWLINE seem to vertically center the stuff properly yet, though.
650|resizing window horiz. changes table layout incorrectly|load up www.yahoo.com; wiggle around the right edge of the window. notice how NEWLINE the right most table cell bounces around...if NEWLINE you turn on visual debugging you can see the bug more clearly...
651|garbage form buttons|This url has two form buttons at the bottom that have the value: NEWLINE  NEWLINE VALUE='    >   ' & VALUE='   >>   ' NEWLINE  NEWLINE Currently these buttons are garbled with "gt" and "gt;gt;" respectively. The NEWLINE bottom of the 'g's looks wierd too.
652|Server Side Image Maps Do Not Work|Visit this URL for a sample server-side image map (it's a map of the south bay NEWLINE area) that does not work in NGLayout, but works in Navigator.
653|On documents without a title, the viewer title is wrong|If you're browsing a document with the title "Foo Bar" and you subsequently load NEWLINE a document that has no title, the viewer window title remains "Foo Bar." It NEWLINE should be set to "No Title" or the URL of the new page, etc.
654|Text does not display correctly|The ":" gets truncated, I think the text isn't being measured correctly. NEWLINE Here is the HTML: NEWLINE  NEWLINE <BODY TEXT="#000000" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" LINK="#0000CC" VLINK="#800080" NEWLINE ALINK="#800000"> NEWLINE &nbsp; NEWLINE <P><BR><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>WASHINGTON, NEWLINE Aug 6 (Reuters) - A federal judge ordered Microsoft Corp.

655|<DT> in <TD>|original note from Angus: NEWLINE  NEWLINE Ok, I think I figured out the problem. It appears to have something to do with NEWLINE usage of the "DT" tag. NEWLINE  NEWLINE I simpled down the beginning of this document. The first test case appears at NEWLINE the URL below, and has the "DT" tag on the text NEWLINE "Communicator 4.5 (Nova)," which appears in line 54 of the HTML source: NEWLINE http://checkmate/nglayout/bugs/client.html NEWLINE  NEWLINE This URL is the exact same page, except the DT's surrounding the text NEWLINE "Communicator 4.5 (Nova)" have been removed on line NEWLINE 54: NEWLINE http://checkmate/nglayout/bugs/client-nodt.html NEWLINE  NEWLINE Sounds like it might be a parser issue ... forward to Rick if you agree. NEWLINE -angus
656|Selection draw incorrectly at beginning of line|Simple, safe fix.
657|percent-width cells in auto-width tables don't work|not yet implemented: cell widths given as a percentage inside an auto-width NEWLINE table. NEWLINE  NEWLINE the implementation will take place in several steps: NEWLINE straightforward tables (no colspans, no conflicting attributes) NEWLINE tables including colspans NEWLINE tables including conflicting attributes NEWLINE tables including illegal attributes (the sum of percent-widths > 100%, for NEWLINE example)
658|Copying HTML to AIM does not work under windows 95/NT|Copy HTML to AIM seems to work just fine under NT. However, under win 95 and win NEWLINE 98 after a copy is done, AIM doesn't seem to recognize that anything is on the NEWLINE pasteboard.
660|Javascript loaded images get drawn twice|There's javascript on this page load a random image, for some reason it gets NEWLINE called twice.
661|navigator.mimetypes array does not work (blocked on with(document))|I can't seem to get plug-ins to work on release builds on win95. Perhaps this is NEWLINE a known issue ... making note of it here anyway. NEWLINE  NEWLINE What I *do* see in place of a plug-in is a rectangle that never repaints where NEWLINE the plug-in should be.
662|too much whitespace between some elements on aol.com|relatively speaking, the whitespace between the elements seem NEWLINE to be acceptable.  however, i've found another problem on NEWLINE aol.com - not all the links show up. NEWLINE  NEWLINE using the 11/30 build on NT/win98 NEWLINE 1) Go to the My News section NEWLINE 2) The link generated from the code below NEWLINE    does NOT show up.  only the text preceeding NEWLINE    the link shows up. NEWLINE  NEWLINE <font face="times, times new roman" size="2"> NEWLINE         Get free custom news and weather in <a NEWLINE href="http://dynamic.aol.com/cgi/redir-complex?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.aol.com%2fmy NEWLINE news%2fhome.adp&sid=stat3a">My News</a>.
663|Resizing image in a floating table doesn't reflow text properly|In this example, the first time you load the page, since I didn't specify the NEWLINE height/width of the image, NGlayout loads the document as if the image (which is NEWLINE contained in a table) has zero width/height. NEWLINE  NEWLINE The HTML boils down to this test case: NEWLINE <table align=left><tr><td> NEWLINE <img src="foo.jpg"> NEWLINE </td></table> NEWLINE I am the text that appears to the right of the floating table. I will not reflow NEWLINE when the image foo.jpg comes in and resizes it's parent table. Instead, the NEWLINE foo.jpg image will appear over me.
664|Paragraphs with CSS margin attributes are corrupted|Perhaps corrupted isn't the proper adjective, but I couldn't come up with a NEWLINE better one... NEWLINE  NEWLINE In this example, the only trickiness is a paragraph with left and right CSS NEWLINE margins defined in pixel widths. This seems to cause some wackiness with memory NEWLINE issues - I notice missing text at first, then as I resize the window, garbage NEWLINE characters appear and my system starts running low on memory. NEWLINE  NEWLINE I'm seeing this on a release build on WinNT.
665|Drop-down lists are too large (should have scrollbar)|Two small fixes are needed, and they should effect anything else.
668|image submit controls not responsive|In some pages with an image submit control inside a table, the control will not NEWLINE get any mouse events, so the form will not be submitted. www.nbc.com/tvcentral NEWLINE has a GO image control that fails. www.sportszone.com has a search image control NEWLINE that fails. NEWLINE  NEWLINE On other pages with an image submit, the submit needs to be clicked twice. test8 NEWLINE is an example of this. The problem here is that mouse enter is not being seen by NEWLINE the control.
669|Bad layout with image with ALIGN=LEFT inside UL tags|See the URL <http://opera/users/hecker/publish/dod-license.htm>.  The page looks NEWLINE OK on Communicator 4.5 PR1 but with Raptor (8/12 mid-day build) the image laps NEWLINE over the text.  The problem appears to be with the content being inside NEWLINE <UL>...</UL> tags (albeit not part of a <LI>...</LI> list item); if the <UL> and NEWLINE </UL> tags are removed then the page lays out properly in Raptor (identical to NEWLINE 4.5). NEWLINE  NEWLINE The original page (from which the example above was extracted) is at NEWLINE <http://www.menk.com/dod_license/>.  Note that the page was created and modified NEWLINE exclusively using Composer, and presumably Composer inserted the LI-less UL tags NEWLINE at some point for reasons of its own.
670|assert because we try to BalanceColumnWidths on a continuing frame|continuing frames always get their cell map and column width information from NEWLINE the first-in-flow.  this must be enforced correctly throughout the table code.
671|layout incorrect in tables with 1 row and cells with colspans|colspans in tables with only a single row are meaningless.  However, they are NEWLINE not consistently treated that way in the table code.  The table frame code must NEWLINE be careful to check if there is only a single row and do the right thing with NEWLINE colspans when building the cell map, fluffing out column frames, etc.
672|yahoo margin problem|When browsing www.yahoo.com in the viewer the right margin is not set the same NEWLINE as in Navigator. The viewer has no margin, while Navigator has a margin 3/4 to NEWLINE 1 inch wide.
673|OnDataAvailable() and OnStartBinding() never get called.|I went to this page to test long documents. It is a simple page with a TON of NEWLINE plain text content.

NEWLINE  if( pointSize > 0 ) NEWLINE   pixelSize = (int) - pointSize * pPrmFont->YPixelPerInch / 72.0; NEWLINE  NEWLINE pointSize is the input size (a double), the rounding error is introduced in the NEWLINE conversion to pixel size. NEWLINE The problem is a classic lack of parentheses, the int conversion is happening NEWLINE before the divide by 72.0. NEWLINE To do what was meant, the line should read: NEWLINE   pixelSize = (int) - ((pointSize * pPrmFont->YPixelPerInch) / 72.0); NEWLINE However, this is also wrong. The proper (ie: Windows) way is to round to the NEWLINE rearest integer, not the smallest. According to the NEWLINE Windows docs the code should read: NEWLINE   pixelSize = - MulDiv((int)pointSize, pPrmFont->YPixelPerInch, 72); NEWLINE That would give the correct rounding.

NEWLINE  NEWLINE The new set do not appear to be functional (when I push the buttons, nothing NEWLINE happens).  The 'balloon help'-like floating tags (what are those things called NEWLINE anyway?) have debug info in them, instead of the names that appear next to the NEWLINE original button bars. NEWLINE  NEWLINE This info is: NEWLINE  NEWLINE For "Navigation Toolbar" it says "Debug: no tipString resource for widget Tab3 NEWLINE This message only appears in a DEBUG build" NEWLINE  NEWLINE For "Location Toolbar" it says the same thing, only with "Tab4" in place of NEWLINE "Tab3". NEWLINE  NEWLINE The third tool bar I usually keep minimized, and it doesn't have any "balloon NEWLINE help" here. NEWLINE  NEWLINE I can minimize the extra toolbars, and they seem to pretty much go away, NEWLINE although they leave a slightly thick line between the 'real' toolbars and the NEWLINE main window. NEWLINE  NEWLINE The platform where I'm seeing this is Data General DG/UX UNIX.  I don't know if NEWLINE this problem shows up on other platforms or not.
739|HP-UX's cfront C++ ("CC") can't build 4th September 1998 Mozilla|28th July 1998 release of Mozilla built with HP's cfront C++ ("CC" command) NEWLINE with only minor changes. 4th September 1998 release of Mozilla has major, NEWLINE major problems building with "CC" on HP-UX 9.X or 10.X (I suspect this may NEWLINE well apply to all cfront-based C++'s, not just HP's).

Really it NEWLINE                              should be defined (HP's ANSI C and ANSI C++ NEWLINE                              both support long long, as does gcc/g++).

740|cmd/xfe/XfeWidgets/Xfe/Pane.c uses illegal cpp conditional|Many cpp's do not like "#ifdef 0" (it's illegal in strict ANSI C I suspect), NEWLINE including HP-UX's ANSI C. Line 1633 of cmd/xfe/XfeWidgets/Xfe/Pane.c uses NEWLINE "#ifdef 0" - it should be "#if 0" of course. HP's ANSI C refuses to compile NEWLINE this file without it being fixed.
741|Typo bug at line 451 of lib/layout/laybuiltin.c|I think there's a typo bug at line 451 of lib/layout/laybuiltin.c: NEWLINE builtin_width was supposed to be asigned to, but the author put builtin->width. NEWLINE Compiler whinges about an uninitialised variable in the original code without NEWLINE this being fixed.
742|NET_DisplayCookieInfoOfSiteAsHTML undefined (during MOZ_LITE build ?)|When linking the 4th September 1998 Mozilla after MOZ_LITE build, the code NEWLINE NET_DisplayCookieInfoOfSiteAsHTML is undefined. It looks like NEWLINE the end of network/protocol/http/mkaccess.c doesn't have a dummy NEWLINE NET_DisplayCookieInfoOfSiteAsHTML() function to satisfy the MOZ_LITE NEWLINE linking.
743|Makefile in xpcom/tests fails to build libreg first|The Makefile (or Makefile.in) in xpcom/tests should have NEWLINE $(DEPTH)/modules/libreg on the DIRS line because NEWLINE libreg.$(DLL_SUFFIX) is mentioned in EX_LIBS, NEWLINE but that librariy isn't actually built at this point NEWLINE in the build, so the make falls over !
744|No 1998-09-04 Mozilla mentioned in Bugzilla when I select the Mozilla product !|Bugzilla displays the various Mozilla products up to the 1998-07-28 release NEWLINE in its scrolling box, but *no* 1998-09-04 release, which is the latest one ! NEWLINE Please fix this - it's getting boring selecting "other" :-)
745|ss:url interrupts cause crash|http://w3 does two redirects, one right after the other. the redirect code calls NEWLINE the WebShell's urlLoad routine with the new url to load. the w3 test NEWLINE case simulates entering a url, hitting enter and entering another url and NEWLINE hitting enter before the first one had a chance to finish. the assert and NEWLINE subsequent crash occurs on the third url entered (i.e. the second NEWLINE interrupt/redirect) in the image library (see modules\\libimg\\src\\if.cpp NEWLINE il_frame_complete_notify() around line: 186). We never seem to be NEWLINE interrupting/aborting the streams we create during the url loads when they're NEWLINE interrupted with another top level load. Are we handling interruption yet? Does NEWLINE this bug look like an interruption issue?
746|missing CSS styles|we don't seem to apply the style to the various paragraphs defined at the top NEWLINE of the page.
747|Bulleted list items eat anchors|if a list item starts with an anchor, ie: NEWLINE <ol> NEWLINE <li><a href=foo>item</a> one</li> NEWLINE <li>item two</li> NEWLINE <li>item three</li> NEWLINE </ol> NEWLINE  NEWLINE then the anchor gets treated like a bullet, and the item doesn't get a real NEWLINE bullet.
748|Bugzilla OS versions missing|The "OS" field lists only up to MacOS version 7.5. 8.1 is the current MacOS NEWLINE version. There were also 7.6 and 8.0 releases

751|GetPosition in nsTextFrame is slow|Currently it does a linear scan forward. A simple demonstration of why this is NEWLINE very bad can be made by creating a text element with, say 10,000 characters in NEWLINE it, and then watching the selection speed suck. NEWLINE  NEWLINE Something on the order of a binary search seeded assuming the x coordinate maps NEWLINE to 1/2 the max-width of the font will probably work much better
752|nsISelection needs to be XPCOM'd|And while you are at it, you should clean up SelectionRange and NEWLINE SelectionPoint. Since they need to be visible to nsISelection, NEWLINE they should be defined (as structs) in nsISelection and frozen NEWLINE forever. NEWLINE  NEWLINE Second, the API's to get them should return const&'s and (for ranges and NEWLINE point's). NEWLINE  NEWLINE If you want me to review it, I'll be glad to review it before you complete it.
753|Combined nsImage* & gfxImageFrame|Setting all current Open/Normal to M4.
754|CSS Selectors not targetting tags properly.|At this page: NEWLINE http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/current/sec15.htm NEWLINE  NEWLINE in win95 osr2 with the august 2nd build, the second line that reads: "This NEWLINE sentence should be green." is not green.  It is black.
755|rdf netchrome causes scroll bar flashing|Mozilla starts up, displays one page and then freezes. If I edit NEWLINE /etc/hosts and point rdf.netscape.com to some invalid ip address NEWLINE then mozilla will start up without freezing but i'm unable to NEWLINE follow links. A few minutes later a blank popup appears (presumably NEWLINE an error message) and two scrollbar sized strips along the right and NEWLINE bottom edges of the frame start flashing between gray and white. NEWLINE  NEWLINE Looking in gdb, it looks like there's an infinite loop with the code NEWLINE thrashing around between doc_bbox_changed_func and scroller_resize. Every NEWLINE few iterations in doc_bbox_changed_func the bounding box has a height NEWLINE and width of zero.
756|ABBR not handled correctly|Not sure if this is a parser or a content model problem, but ABBR seems to hose NEWLINE things. NGLayout inserts a newline before any ABBR content, and may hose nearby NEWLINE inline markup.
757|"width" property not properly enforced|The "width" property is not properly enforced. The URL specifies a DIV with a NEWLINE width of 400px. But the width of this element is always sized to fit the NEWLINE browser window width.
758|Highlighting text in the viewer causes the app to crash|Highlighting text in the viewer (by clicking and dragging with the mouse) NEWLINE causes the application to crash with an Application Error in NEWLINE NetscapeDispatchWnd. Looks like you tried to read a zero pointer.
759|Mozilla inserts a few pixels of space between the border and the padding/content|The summary pretty much sums it up; see the URL provided for an example.
760|Problem with the background of a parent element|Refer to the example. The background specified for the outer DIV should show NEWLINE through in the margins of the inner DIV.
761|CSS "width" not interpreted correctly.|The "width" property should specify the "content width". This is the space NEWLINE *between* the left and right padding. So, if the width is 40, and the padding NEWLINE on each side is 10, the width of the [content width] + [padding] would be 60. NEWLINE Please refer to the example. It specifies a with of 400px, but Mozilla renders NEWLINE it with a width of only ~240 pixels.
762|Block element between left- and right-floated images is rendered incorrectly|Please refer to the example. Mozilla puts the images in the right place, but NEWLINE the content of the DIV should be *between* them. Mozilla has it rendered tall NEWLINE and skinny way off to the right.
763|Display "jumps" when resized|When resizing navigator window, layout of all pieces on screen jumps about ten NEWLINE pizels down and right. Unfortunately, I just noticed that text-entry fields will NEWLINE sometimes (on first resize?) completely lose their positioning as well, which NEWLINE turns out little more severe problem.
764|UTF8 strings in taskbar...|New bookmarks code sucks in taskbar elements, however for some reason this code NEWLINE doesn't handle UTF8 strings. Program entries like 'Forté Agent' cause a volley NEWLINE of ASSERT()'s and an eventual memory error.
765|Erased bookmark folder doesn't accept bookmarks|Well, here's an unsurprising bug... when you remove ("Cut") the bookmarks-folder NEWLINE from the toolbars, and subsequently try to create another bookmark, things crash NEWLINE since the bookmark-folder doesn't exist. Presumably, Mozilla shouldn't allow one NEWLINE to Cut off the active bookmark-folder (Like it doesn't allow you to do with new NEWLINE bookmarks-folder).
766|Empty title in 'history' list|I was unable to reproduce this as of yet, so there isn't much to tell. While NEWLINE trying to access a very slow-loading page I started browsing thru the pull-down NEWLINE menues, until Mozilla suddenly came down on an ASSERT().

772|Incorrect display of this page|I've just downloaded the latest Win32 build of Mozilla and was visiting NEWLINE the following link which rendered incorrectly. I thought sending this to NEWLINE you might help in debugging the problem. NEWLINE  NEWLINE http://www.w3.org/RDF/Implementations/SiRPAC/
773|Chunked decoding can get stuck in STRIP_CRLF state|The state machine in net_ChunkedWrite in mozilla/network/cnvts/cvchunk.c assumes NEWLINE that obj->in_buf always contains a CRLF when in the STRIP_CRLF state. That's not NEWLINE always true so Mozilla gets stuck in an infinite loop. This seems to happen on NEWLINE certain cgi programs which spit out very small chunks. A patch is available.

778|[PP] Time code wrong?|At Mozilla startup, NetscapeDebug says it will expire October, 1994.  Not a real NEWLINE problem, but disconcerting.  If this is based on some system call, is all time NEWLINE related code in Mozilla for MacOS wrong?
779|Images not loading occasionally|I don't know if this only affects macs or not (or if this is the right category), NEWLINE but after 5 minutes of surfing or so, NavigatorDebug will stop loading images, NEWLINE displaying the broken image picture.  This most frequently happens at NEWLINE slashdot.org.

Gives me an NEWLINE error that reads: NEWLINE  NEWLINE "the MOZILLA.EXE file is linked to missing export MFCO42D.DLL:3300" NEWLINE  NEWLINE I've tried both an older version of MFC42D.DLL, MFCO42D.DLL, MSVCIRTD.DLL, and NEWLINE MSVCRTD.DLL (from MSVC 4.x), and the newest versions (from Dev Studio 6.0).

783|Word Netscape in Sept 7th build.|Assorted dialog boxes still say "Netscape" or "Navigator".  The lock file NEWLINE warning for multiple sessions is one of them. NEWLINE  NEWLINE Another is when typing the URL to go to another page, the title of Mozilla NEWLINE before it loads the page is still "Netscape Navigator". NEWLINE  NEWLINE Adding a #define for company/product name would prevent quite a few headaches NEWLINE later for people who may miss one or ten... NEWLINE  NEWLINE As I said, it's trivial.
784|Mangled graphics in 9/7/98|Look at the right side of the "Features", "Quick Links" and "Books" tables. NEWLINE Normally they have a shadow graphic in it.  Netscape 4.05 correctly renders the NEWLINE graphic while Mozilla 9/7/98 renders it as broken black fill.  If I "shake" the NEWLINE vertical scroll bar up and down, I can change the pattern of the broken black NEWLINE fill.  Looks pretty strange.
785|{sink} Handling frameset's with bodies|When dealing with a framset document mBody will be NULL, but DidBuildModel() NEWLINE is called anyway. Down at the bottom of the function there's some code that NEWLINE informs the document that content has been appended: NEWLINE  NEWLINE mDocument->ContentAppended(mBody, mBodyChildCount); NEWLINE  NEWLINE I added a NULL pointer check around the call (and an additional call that I NEWLINE added, which had been crashing), but we probably shouldn't be calling this NEWLINE function at all for framesets
786|Use of rowspan causes cursor to not change when over link, but link works|See the referenced URL; the first link is recognized as an active link and can NEWLINE be clicked on, but while the second is rendered properly it cannot be clicked on NEWLINE (mouseover of the link is apparently not recognized).  This is with an NGLayout NEWLINE build as of 10 September 1998. NEWLINE  NEWLINE The HTML to cause this bug (also at the referenced URL)is surprisingly simple: NEWLINE  NEWLINE <TABLE> NEWLINE  NEWLINE <TR> NEWLINE <TD ROWSPAN=2> NEWLINE  NEWLINE <TABLE> NEWLINE <TR><TD><A HREF="01.html">01</A></TD></TR> NEWLINE <TR><TD><A HREF="02.html">02</A></TD></TR> NEWLINE </TABLE> NEWLINE  NEWLINE </TD> NEWLINE </TR> NEWLINE  NEWLINE <TR><TD>03</TD></TR> NEWLINE  NEWLINE </TABLE> NEWLINE  NEWLINE If either the ROWSPAN or the last table row is removed ("03") then the problem NEWLINE goes away. NEWLINE  NEWLINE Note that this appears to be the root cause for why half the links on the NEWLINE mozilla.org page <http://www.mozilla.org/> do not work in the NGLayout viewer. NEWLINE (I extracted the above from the mozilla.org HTML source.)

801|Crashes|You should put in that GPF crash detector/reporter which is in Netscape 4.5b1 NEWLINE into Mozilla.  Then you could set up a server side of the bug reporter which NEWLINE would delete multiple entries of the same crash.
802|{list} bullets positioned strangely around floats|The bulleted list items in column two are positioned too far to the left.
803|Floaters Aren't Resized Properly|Floaters with a percentage 'width' property aren't resized like they should be NEWLINE when the window is resized. NEWLINE  NEWLINE This page demonstrates a two column display using a floated left DIV for column NEWLINE width. The width is 50%
804|Miami University page will not load.|The web page above causes the September 13th and 12th Windows builds to crash NEWLINE upon rendering.

806|milestone branch reminder -> User agent implementation needs update|From: cyeh@netscape.com (Christopher Yeh) NEWLINE  NEWLINE As you go about designing Raptor, would you please take a moment and decide NEWLINE a simple XP way of specifing the version and user agent string?  I can't NEWLINE tell you how painful it is everytime we decide to bump either in the NEWLINE current 5.0 code base. You have to muck with each FE in a completely NEWLINE different way. NEWLINE  NEWLINE If there was a single file that was used to config all platforms, that NEWLINE would be my dream. NEWLINE  NEWLINE Thanks. NEWLINE  NEWLINE Chris Yeh
807|'em' units don't work|In general, 'em' units don't work as length values. NEWLINE  NEWLINE See issue #1 in the nglayout test document
808|padding and borders don't work on HTML and BODY elements|Setting padding and/or margins on HTML/BODY elements don't have NEWLINE any effect (with the exception of padding on BODY elements). NEWLINE  NEWLINE For a test case, See issue #2 in the attached UR
809|block-level elements don't strech out to the right|For a test case, See issue #3 in the attached URL
810|borders around elements eat their way into text|For a test case, See issue #4 in the attached URL
811|default margin on DIV elements is non-zero|This is not a bug since User Agents are free to use any default NEWLINE style sheet. I do think margins values should be zero in the NEWLINE browser's default style sheet, though. NEWLINE  NEWLINE For a test case, See issue #6 in the attached URL
812|no left padding|The left (or perhaps, horizontal) padding on block-level NEWLINE elements seem to be ignored. NEWLINE  NEWLINE For a test case, See issue #4 in the attached URL
813|element widths|When elements are set to e.g. 50%, the textual content is constrained, NEWLINE but the background rectangle is unconstrained. NEWLINE  NEWLINE For a test case, See issue #7 in the attached URL
814|overlapping floating elements - no!|Floating elements should not overlap when space is to tight. NEWLINE  NEWLINE This is described in [1]: NEWLINE  NEWLINE      If the current box is left-floating, and there are any left NEWLINE      floating boxes generated by elements earlier in the source document, NEWLINE      then for each such earlier box, either the left outer edge of the NEWLINE      current box must be to the right of the right outer edge of the NEWLINE      earlier box, or its top must be lower than the bottom of the NEWLINE      earlier box. Analogous rules hold for right-floating boxes. NEWLINE  NEWLINE [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/visuren.html#floats NEWLINE  NEWLINE I know this is different from how NS traditionally lays out NEWLINE floating images. I think the time has come to change that behavior NEWLINE -- or, alternatively -- let floating text elements behave NEWLINE differently from floating images.
815|We shouldn't process content inside <NOSCRIPT> tags|Currently we're processing content inside NOSCRIPT tags.  This problem is most NEWLINE visible on various Netcenter pages, the first of which being the sign in page. NEWLINE The sign in page uses a meta-redirect inside a NOSCRIPT tag to avoid non script NEWLINE browsers.  We need to get this fixed if we want to be able to test Netcenter in NEWLINE NGLayout.
816|HTML tags leaking into edit field|Go to the sign in page for Netcenter.  One way to get there is via NEWLINE my.netscape.com, then click on 'I am already a My Netscape User. Find My NEWLINE Page!'.  When the page comes up you'll note at '></TD>' inside the first text NEWLINE field.  Unfortunately, the page will then immediately flash away due to bug NEWLINE #815, parsing content inside NOSCRIPT tags.
817|XP timebomb code needed for betas|Something else you probably haven't thought of is timebomb code. NEWLINE  NEWLINE At some magical point, you'll be releasing betas, and you'll need a way to NEWLINE disable the engine after a particular date and time, or relative to the first NEWLINE launching of Raptor. NEWLINE  NEWLINE This should be implemented in an XP way.
818|Internet Explorer can't handle server-push pages.|When querying the bugzilla database the cgi spits out lots of "-- NEWLINE ThisRandomString".  Most of the time this is just annoying, but sometimes (if NEWLINE you try and get a list of all the bugs in NGLayout for instance) it puts it NEWLINE infront of the MIME header confusing the browser somewhat.

838|Mozilla fails to build correctly on any non-gcc/g++ HP-UX compiler|Well, I'm back again with my exploits on HP-UX 10.20 and the by-now-surely- NEWLINE infamous 4th September 1998 Mozilla build - here's a progress report: NEWLINE  NEWLINE * HP's cfront-based C++ ("CC" command) just can't build 4th Sept 98 Mozilla NEWLINE   at all (bombs out early during the compile and many fixes later convinced NEWLINE   me to give up). All previous Mozilla releases built fine with "CC", so there's NEWLINE   a lot of "g++-isms" been added with the 4th Sept release I suspect. NEWLINE  NEWLINE * HP's ANSI C++ ("aCC" command) can actually build Mozilla, but it core dumps NEWLINE   during intiialisation. I didn't really fancy debugging this, so I concentrated NEWLINE   on installing the latest gcc/libstdc++ and using that to build Mozilla NEWLINE   instead. NEWLINE  NEWLINE * gcc 2.8.1/libstdc++ 2.8.1.1 both builds Mozilla and manages to run Mozilla NEWLINE   on HP-UX 10.20, but there's serious problems with background tiling - loads NEWLINE   of graphical corruption on any pages with background tiles. NEWLINE  NEWLINE So the advice is to stick with gcc/g++ for building Mozilla on HP-UX - all NEWLINE other compilers don't work. Even gcc/g++ produces that background tile problem NEWLINE though. Has anyone at Netscape actually managed to build the 4th Sept 98 NEWLINE Mozilla at all and get it to work sensibly ? NEWLINE  NEWLINE BTW, there's a major omission in the build config for Mozilla - a "mid-way" NEWLINE build - i.e. one without optimisation *or* debugging. I ended up having to NEWLINE hack around in 3 or 4 places to get rid of the -O's (whilst keeping BUILD_OPT NEWLINE defined). I did this to rule out optimisation bugs in gcc/g++ (I ruled them out: NEWLINE same problem with a non-optimised build).

841|[PP]changing visited link color crashes Mozilla|I just downloaded the 9/18/98 binary of Mozilla for Mac/PPC.  I am running MacOS NEWLINE 8.1 on a PowerMac G3/300 with 128MB of RAM. NEWLINE  NEWLINE I launched Mozilla and was successfully playing around with it when I tried to NEWLINE change the visited link color (to red) in the prefs dialog.  Shortly after I hit NEWLINE the OK button, it crashed with a Type 3 error. NEWLINE  NEWLINE After that, running the same user configuration caused Mozilla to crash while NEWLINE starting up.  I was able to create a new user, and tried changing the visited NEWLINE link color again--it crashed again.  I tried downloading a fresh copy of NEWLINE Mozilla, and the same thing occurred.  In short, this bug seems very repeatable. NEWLINE  NEWLINE Cordially, NEWLINE Steven G. Johnson
842|No MacOS 8 option in "OS" popup|The "OS" popup menu only lists "System 7" and "System 7.5".  Besides the fact NEWLINE that it would be more correct (and clear) to write "MacOS" instead of "System," NEWLINE there is the obvious omission of no MacOS 8, 8.1, or 8.5 options.  There is a NEWLINE cryptic "7.1.6" option; I have no clue what OS that is supposed to be.  You're NEWLINE also missing Windows 98.
843|Colour controls not disabled when preference dialog opened|If the "Use Windows Colors" preference setting is turned on, and then the NEWLINE "Preferences" dialog is opened and the Appearance:Colours pane selected, the NEWLINE "Text" and "Background" colour selectors should be disabled and dimmed, but NEWLINE instead they are left enabled and visible.   If you then click the "Use windows NEWLINE colours" checkbox twice so that it is turned off and then back on, the "Text" NEWLINE and "Background" colour selectors become diabled and dimmed as they should be NEWLINE when the dialog is opened.

See http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS1#containment-in- NEWLINE html , where the P elements (about half of the page) should be red.

848|Viewer App Reports incorrect HTTP_USER_AGENT version|NGLayout for Windows reports that is the WinNT version of Netscape 4.05.  This NEWLINE is done on line 516 of /webshell/tests/viewer/nsViewerApp.cpp .  The string is NEWLINE currently set to "4.05 [en] (WinNT;I)".  It should probably be set to something NEWLINE like "5.5b0 NGLayout" and possibly contain a build date or platform.  However, NEWLINE it is very important that it be changed to *anything else* because the reporting NEWLINE version 4.05 causes NGLayout to receive browser-sniffed versions of CSS for Win NEWLINE Navigator 4 that don't send the stuff that crashes Navigator 4 (lots of stuff). NEWLINE However, you may need to use a version number such as 5.5test or 6.0test for the NEWLINE benefit of other types of browser sniffing (I'm not sure what is out there). NEWLINE  NEWLINE This is related to bug 806, but I think this should be changed even before a NEWLINE cross-platform way of changing it is made so that NGLayout can be tested NEWLINE properly.&#137;
849|Somtimes forgets scrollbar, sometimes draws blank page.|If you enter something into the advanced query box (e.g. fish and vitamins) and NEWLINE do a search, then the resulting page will not have the necessary vertical NEWLINE scrollbar.  If you press the down arrow or drag the mouse down across the bottom NEWLINE of the screen, the scrollbar will appear. NEWLINE  NEWLINE Jump to page 10 and click on a search result, then jump back.  The page will be NEWLINE completely white.  Refresh does not do anything, bu redraw does.  This is fairly NEWLINE reproducable.  Actually, I think just trying a few links on the first page NEWLINE should suffice instead of going to page 10.
850|CSS Universal Selector should be supported|In a style system where style sheets can cascade, it is important to support the NEWLINE CSS2 universal selector, "*", as described in the CSS2 spec at the URL above, NEWLINE and with priority rules as defined at NEWLINE http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/cascade.html#specificity NEWLINE  NEWLINE This is needed in case a user style sheet defines, for example, a color or NEWLINE background-color for B, EM, DT, or some other similar element.  The page author, NEWLINE to override this, would either need to define his color and background-color on NEWLINE every single element, or use the universal selector.  This is why it is so NEWLINE important (but is only useful in the context of *cascading* style sheets.) NEWLINE &#137;

883|BUILD: Mozilla does not build on ARM Linux|Building Mozilla on an ARM Linux box fails (tested on Corel NetWinder). NEWLINE  NEWLINE The file mozilla/nsprpub/pr/include/md/_linux.h does not contain the NEWLINE definitions for _MD_GET_SP, _MD_SET_FP, etc. NEWLINE  NEWLINE Also, gcc on ARM Linux defines, by default, characters as unsigned, while NEWLINE an explicit manifest for all Linux platforms defines HAVE_SIGNED_CHAR.

891|Segfault on exit.|Using current CVS source.  Mozilla always segfaults on exiting (File -> Exit). NEWLINE Happens on both my builds and the mozilla.org builds.
892|Config directory ignored|Using current CVS source.  Even if MOZ_USER_DIR is set to something like NEWLINE ".mozilla", it is still saving the preferences to ".netscape".  Some of this NEWLINE appears to be hard-coded.
893|forced new line after </NOSCRIPT> when combined with margin-right|In the example pointed to by the URL, one can see an extra new line after the NEWLINE words "ionic concentration."  This extra new-line is only present after the NEWLINE active second pair of NOSCRIPT-/NOSCRIPT tags (comment the second pair out and NEWLINE the new line will move down to the next pair).  This behavior occurs only when NEWLINE the "ModuleText" class assigned to the DIV enveloping the entire text has the NEWLINE "margin-right" property set to some value.

895|Reword compilation warning on Win95 build|Under Windows 95, the following warning is issued: NEWLINE  NEWLINE "Cannot recursively make on win95 using command.com, use w95make" NEWLINE  NEWLINE The wording implies an error occured because w95make should be used but isn't. NEWLINE In truth, it is simply a warning indicating w95make is in use. NEWLINE  NEWLINE This message is repeated scores of times during the make on win95, yet it NEWLINE seems to be irrelevant.  It should either be removed or reworded to be more NEWLINE correct:  "Using w95make instead of recursive make"
896|Default file association questioning|Every time Mozilla is launched, it asks if it should register the default file NEWLINE extension associations.  No matter what one answers, the message always pops up, NEWLINE even if the check box is clicked to indicate it not do so. NEWLINE  NEWLINE Note that in spite of this, the file associations seem to be set correctly.
897|Fail to load homepage|I have set my homepage preferences to NEWLINE http://www.neptune.net/~bryce/startup.html.  This should cause this page to be NEWLINE loaded when Mozilla is first launched, and whenever the home button is pressed. NEWLINE  NEWLINE However, Mozilla seems to get hung up between looking up the domain name and NEWLINE making contact with the server, and it never loads the homepage.  However, if NEWLINE Stop is pressed and the home button pushed, it will load the homepage just fine.
898|Extra error message when PPP not established|When Mozilla is launched without an established PPP connection, it normally NEWLINE returns an error message stating that the startup page is not accessable. NEWLINE Sometimes, however, an additional error message pops up regarding an rdf server NEWLINE not being available. NEWLINE  NEWLINE It would probably be best to combine these two error messages, or prevent the NEWLINE RDF error message from showing.
899|The New Bookmark dialog box does not respond to mouse input|When accessing the New Bookmark command listed in the context menu from the NEWLINE toolbar, a dialog titled "Mozilla User Prompt". NEWLINE  NEWLINE This dialog does not respond to mouse signals in any way.  The cursor does not NEWLINE even change shape as it passes over the edit box.
900|Listbox size overrun for font preferences|One of the fonts installed on my system is called SPW.  This font consists of NEWLINE sheet music symbols, like treble cleff, half note, etc. etc. NEWLINE  NEWLINE In the font preferences page, there are a pair of list boxes showing the NEWLINE different fonts as they actually appear.  For some reason, SPW is listed as a NEWLINE font, and it appears to be forcing a resize of these controls.  Both listboxes NEWLINE are increased height-wise, and this causes the top font listbox to slightly NEWLINE overlap the lower font listbox. NEWLINE  NEWLINE It would look better if the spacing between the two listboxes was doubled, of if NEWLINE a better filter mechanism could be found to weed symbolic fonts out of the NEWLINE listing.
901|Auto-refresh page does not auto-refresh|This NASA page is supposed to auto-refresh every 30 seconds. It does in MSIE4, NEWLINE but *not* in NN4.06 or Moz (9/24/98 Win32 build, from MozillaZine.org)
902|Applet problem in Netscape|If I load an applet from Netscape Browser which is calling a Native method NEWLINE through a helper class, after the function is called if I refer the return NEWLINE value from Native call the browser crashes with "Bus Core" error. This NEWLINE behaviour is same in 4.x and 4.5. I checked the same code with "appletviewer" NEWLINE and as well as console application, in both the case it works fine. The same NEWLINE applet works fine if I load it from Netscape running on Windows where the NEWLINE native library is in the form of DLL. The Native library is not using any NEWLINE system call, it is a simple example which returns a "NewStringUTF". NEWLINE  NEWLINE This is a potential bug with Netscape browsers.

903|Font Performance Problems|The GetWidth() member functions of nsFontMetricsWin are causing serious NEWLINE performance problems, because each time they make the following calls: NEWLINE - GetDC() NEWLINE - ReleaseDC() NEWLINE - SelectObject() NEWLINE  NEWLINE Plus the ftol overhead is a problem as well
904|Implement repeating, prioritised timers on Mac|The timer API and implementation doesn't support repeating timers, and this NEWLINE causes a large number of temporary timer objects to be created and NEWLINE destroyed; e.g., view mgr, throbber, image system services
905|nsFont embedded nsString object|nsFont objects tend to be used on the stack, e.g. by TextFrame in its Paint() NEWLINE member function, and because nsFont contains a nsString object that allocates NEWLINE space from the heap, we end up with a large number of temporary object NEWLINE generated. NEWLINE  NEWLINE We either need to not have nsFont allocate the string from the heap, or re-think NEWLINE the usage pattern: e.g., TextFrame is defining a nsFont instance so it can NEWLINE override the decoration that's in the style information

911|Fix(?) for crash when quickly launching multiple windows|Not sure if I have the right component for this one...  Pardon if not so. NEWLINE It might belong to the RDF or the Cookies folks. NEWLINE  NEWLINE I found a bug that occurs when one opens a number of windows, which may NEWLINE be related to a low memory condition, and somehow to cookies. NEWLINE  NEWLINE I've located the bug exactly and have a patch that seems to stop the NEWLINE bug.  However, whatever condition happens when this bug crops up is now NEWLINE causing a bug in a different area of the program (I think) so this isn't NEWLINE a total fix. NEWLINE  NEWLINE I'm running WinNT4.0 SR3, on a 166MHz Dell Pentium with 64MB RAM and NEWLINE 200MB swap.  In addition to WinNT processes and mozilla, I am running NEWLINE cdplayer.exe, MSACCESS, TASKMGR, MSDEV, CRT, and a notepad-like editor. NEWLINE  NEWLINE The crash occurs when 4-8 windows are opened in rapid succession (within NEWLINE 30 sec or so).  The faster one opens windows, the sooner the error will NEWLINE occur. NEWLINE  NEWLINE I was looking at nine web pages on CGI scripts, looking for the NEWLINE slashdot source code.  I had run a search on "slashdot.cgi" and opened NEWLINE up a bunch of windows to view the results of the search.  Seven of the NEWLINE pages loaded, the final two hadn't loaded up fully at the time of crash. NEWLINE Error was reported "Access violation".

NEWLINE  NEWLINE Error was:  "Unhandled exception in mozilla.exe:  0xC0000005: Access NEWLINE Violation." NEWLINE  NEWLINE Crashed on the same line of the same function.

NEWLINE  NEWLINE  NEWLINE My first impression of what's going on is: NEWLINE -  Mozilla, while idle, polls the sockets. NEWLINE -  Since net_calling_all_the_time_count != 0 (it's set to 5, in this NEWLINE    case) NEWLINE -  NET_ProcessNet is called, which allows multiple connections to be NEWLINE    processed simultaneously. NEWLINE -  ready_fd = NULL, so an attempt to find a socket is made NEWLINE -  a bunch of code is run to set up the socket (I think...) NEWLINE -  sockets ready for reading are processed one by one NEWLINE -  tmpEntry->busy is false, so processing proceeds NEWLINE -  ready_fd = 0, and since both tmpEntry->socket and tmpEntry->con_sock NEWLINE    are NULL, the else if statement is executed. NEWLINE -  The line NEWLINE         rv = (*tmpEntry->proto_impl->process)(tmpEntry); NEWLINE    evaluates to NEWLINE         rv = net_ProcessFile(tmpEntry); NEWLINE    and so net_ProcessFile is called. NEWLINE -  net_ProcessFile is called for the file "M1AIR9QS.GIF", which is a NEWLINE    picture of the USSR flag. NEWLINE -  con_data->next_state = 15, which is NET_FILE_DONE NEWLINE -  con_data->stream is non-zero, so the macro COMPLETE_STREAM is run. NEWLINE -  con_data->next_state is set to NET_FILE_FREE NEWLINE -  ProcessCookiesAndTrustLabels is called: NEWLINE -  Checks are made:  trust labels is enabled, ce is non-null, and NEWLINE    ce->URL_s is non-null.  All pass. NEWLINE -  A loop is made through all the headers (I think?) NEWLINE -  Loop runs from 0 to ce->URL_s->all_headers.empty_index, which equals NEWLINE    3722304989.  Hmm.  Here's the problem. NEWLINE  NEWLINE Okay, now to figure out a solution.  Obviously this cookie code NEWLINE shouldn't be called in some cases. NEWLINE  NEWLINE I don't think it's the pages themselves that's causing the crash, but NEWLINE rather the strain of loading several heavy duty pages all at once. NEWLINE  NEWLINE Here are the exact pages I loaded: NEWLINE http://harbor.ecn.purdue.edu/~jacoby/Slashdot_Mailer/ NEWLINE http://www.krazi.org/ NEWLINE http://www.stars.com/vlib/providers/cgi.html NEWLINE http://www.hax0r.org/ NEWLINE http://www.icemall.com/free/free_perl_scripts.html NEWLINE  NEWLINE I'm going to load each one in turn and see if one page in particular is NEWLINE causing the problem... NEWLINE  NEWLINE Nope.  I loaded each page up in a single browser, with no crash.  Then I NEWLINE went nuts loading links into new browsers.  I loaded up half a dozen NEWLINE links out of the list on NEWLINE http://www.icemall.com/free/free_perl_scripts.html and got the same NEWLINE error that I've been having. NEWLINE  NEWLINE Tried again, this time only got four windows opened. I was a tad NEWLINE slower in launching the windows this time. NEWLINE  NEWLINE Here's a possible fix.  Change the code to look like this: NEWLINE  NEWLINE void ProcessCookiesAndTrustLabels( ActiveEntry *ce ) NEWLINE { NEWLINE #define	TEN_MINUTES (time_t)(10*60) /* 10 minutes in seconds */ NEWLINE     unsigned int i; NEWLINE     TrustLabel *ALabel; NEWLINE     XP_List *TempTrustList; NEWLINE  NEWLINE     if ( IsTrustLabelsEnabled() && ce && ce->URL_s NEWLINE         && ce->URL_s->all_headers.empty_index != 0xdddddddd NEWLINE         ) { NEWLINE  NEWLINE The code under the if statement shouldn't really be executed when NEWLINE empty_index is set to such a large number.  The program still crashes, NEWLINE but in a different location, and it seems to allow more web pages to NEWLINE load.  I think this new way of crashing is not related to the fix I just NEWLINE made, but I'm not certain.  I'll submit it as a separate bug report once NEWLINE I have more info on it.

NEWLINE  NEWLINE I assume joki owns this piece of the bug... NEWLINE  NEWLINE - we should underline the first instance of the accesskey character.

NEWLINE The SECOND time it respects the width= and height= tags.
1034|NetscapeDispatchWnd crashes on URL|Last line in \\bin\\viewer.exe: NEWLINE DocumentViewerImpl::BindToDocument NEWLINE  NEWLINE Fatal error: NEWLINE  NEWLINE The instruction at "0x00291048" referened memory at "0xdddddded".  Memory could NEWLINE not be "read". NEWLINE  NEWLINE &#137;
1035|Scrollbars:  Layout not knowing when scrollbars are present?|On numerious pages, including my own, Mozilla appearenly does not know that NEWLINE scrollbars are present, and does not align the text along the scollbar, NEWLINE instead along the screen edge, which causes about 5-6 pixels worth of text to be NEWLINE lost under the scollbars.  After going in to the display control panel and NEWLINE changing the size of the scrollbars, mozilla started laying things out properly NEWLINE durring its current session.  If mozilla is restared thought, the toolbars once NEWLINE again block content.
1036|Forward Button Broken|Aargh!  The forward button stopped working in the 10-8 build.  (Or else I'm NEWLINE hallucinating, which is unlikely.)&#137;
1037|border-color-left,right,top,bottom broken|The following renders all sides with the same color. It should have the NEWLINE appearance of an inset or outset (with adjacent color boundaries at 45%). NEWLINE  NEWLINE <html> NEWLINE <body> NEWLINE <DIV style="width: 30px; height: 30px; border-color: NEWLINE red,black,red,black;"></DIV> NEWLINE <DIV style="width: 30px; height: 30px; border-color-left: red; border-color-top: NEWLINE black; border-color-right: red; border-color-bottom: black;"></DIV> NEWLINE </body> NEWLINE </html>
1038|fantasy and cursive fonts are treated as sans-serif and something else|Fantasy and cursive fonts (as declared in CSS) aren't quite treated as I would NEWLINE expect them to be.  Fantasy is treated the same as sans-serif, and cursive is NEWLINE just a serif font that is a little different from Times.  (This is what happens NEWLINE in Windows.)&#137;
1039|Negative CSS font-size should not be allowed|According to the spec's rules for error-handling, negative font sizes should not NEWLINE be allowed.  See NEWLINE http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/fonts.html#font-size-props&#137;
1040|CSS vertical-align problems; reflow strange|vertical-align: middle (bug 606, maybe), vertical-align: text-bottom (I'm not NEWLINE sure about this one), and vertical-align: 50% do not work.&#137;
1041|Percentage margins don't shrink when the browser window gets narrow|The percentage margins in the following pages don't shrink any more when the NEWLINE browser window is narrowed beyond a certain point (about half the width of my NEWLINE screen, I think): NEWLINE http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/current/sec5501.htm NEWLINE http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/current/sec5502.htm NEWLINE http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/current/sec5503.htm NEWLINE http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/current/sec5504.htm NEWLINE http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/current/sec5505.htm NEWLINE &#137;
1042|CSS auto margins don't justify blocks|The setting of left, right, or both margins to auto should (respectively) right- NEWLINE justify, left-justify, or center a block whose width is less than 100%.&#137;
1043|DIV should be considered to terminate a P|A DIV should be considered to end a P element that does not have an end tag. NEWLINE See the URL for example and link to specs.&#137;
1044|inheritance problems in tables|tables don't inherit the properties of a surrounding DIV (and it's clear that NEWLINE the problem is *not* that a table is being (incorrectly) considered to be the NEWLINE end of a DIV).  See the Example URL, where the text in the DIV shows up properly NEWLINE on both sides of the table, but incorrectly within the table.&#137;
1045|CSS background-attachment|It would be nice to support the CSS1 properties background-position and NEWLINE background-attachment.  There seems to be some attempt at supporting background- NEWLINE position, since it sometimes seems to cause a background that is tiled only in NEWLINE one direction (using background-repeat) to run twice in that direction NEWLINE (parallel) rather than once.  See the URL given for an example.  See tests NEWLINE 5.3.4, 5.3.6, and 5.3.7 (link above) for examples of these properties.&#137;
1046|letter-spacing should apply on space characters too [INLINE]|It would be nice to support the CSS attributes word-spacing and letter-spacing. NEWLINE Although I would have to say I would put them among the lowest priorities in NEWLINE CSS1, I think they are still definitely worth implementing, especially if you NEWLINE want to claim complete CSS1 support.&#137;
1047|CSS text-align: justify doesn't work|The justify keyword for the text-align property doesn't do anything.  It just NEWLINE acts as though it were text-align: left.&#137;
1048|CSS property text-indent not supported|text-indent is not supported.  I think this is one of the more commonly used and NEWLINE better supported properties.&#137;
1049|{css1} CSS list-style-position not supported|The CSS1 property list-style-position is not supported.  (Possible values are NEWLINE inside and outside.  See the above URL).&#137;
1050|Phantom border with CSS border-style set to none|When the CSS property border-style is set to none, the border-width should be NEWLINE displayed as zero.  Currently NGLayout is displaying extra padding filling up NEWLINE the area where that border width would be.  See not only the above test case but NEWLINE the ffour before it, i.e., 5.5.11-5.5.15.&#137;
1051|Default CSS border-width=medium border-style=none|The default CSS border-width is medium and the default border-style is none. NEWLINE You currently seem to use (0,solid) (??) rather than (medium,none).  This means NEWLINE that if border-style is set to solid, then a medium solid border should be NEWLINE drawn, but if border-width is set to something without setting border-style, NEWLINE then nothing should happen.  There are two test cases for this, really (one each NEWLINE way): NEWLINE http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/current/sec5515.htm NEWLINE http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/current/sec5516.htm (the above URL)&#137;
1052|Top borders are a pixel too thin|Top borders seem to be a pixel too thin.  This is especially noticeable in the NEWLINE thin border in the above URL.&#137;
1053|groove and ridge borders are reversed|Based on the light-from-the-upper-left model, which is pretty standard and which NEWLINE you use for inset and outset borders, groove and inset borders got switched.&#137;
1054|{css1} Dashed and dotted borders have ugly corners|The dashed and dotted borders, when thick, are rather ugly at the corners.  I'm NEWLINE not sure what can be done to fix this, but Opera handles it a rather neat way by NEWLINE changing the gaps between the dots and the dashes.&#137;
1055|{css1} BORDER attribute incorrectly overriding CSS rules|The thin top/bottom borders are thinner inside the table than outside.  Appears NEWLINE in NEWLINE top:    http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/current/sec5518.htm (above URL) NEWLINE bottom: http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/current/sec5520.htm&#137;
1056|maxAscent/maxDescent not backed up|when a frame on a line ends up being pushed to the next line we don't backout NEWLINE that frames impact on: NEWLINE  NEWLINE maxAscent NEWLINE maxDescent NEWLINE max-element-size NEWLINE  NEWLINE etc. NEWLINE  NEWLINE Start using the PerFrameData in nsInlineReflow and this can be easily fixed: NEWLINE change the code to compute the max values upon completion instead of on the fly.
1057|Percentage margins load incorrectly if window was resized - better on reflow|Percentage margins load incorrectly if window was resized in the past, I think, NEWLINE but they get better on reflow when the window is resized while the page is NEWLINE displayed.&#137;
1058|Margins not applied|In this page, for some reason, the percentage margins aren't applied in the part NEWLINE outside of the table.  They work within the table.&#137;
1059|Floats within Tables|Floats within Tables are a mess!!  Also the reflow is *very* slow on this page.&#137;
1060|Percentage width floats not resized|The percentage width floats in this page aren't resized when the viewer window NEWLINE size is changed.&#137;
1061|nested quotes not yet supported (<q> CSS quoting)|[This is just a reminder: peter, reassign this to kipp when you have implemented NEWLINE the css2 content attributes - thanks]
1062|Image misaligned in table (extends past cell boundary)|Nightly build October 10th Win 95 (but noticed in prior builds). NEWLINE  NEWLINE A table cell containing two images: layout misaligns the top image so that the NEWLINE top image crosses into the next cell (to right hand side of "home" cell for the NEWLINE image). NEWLINE  NEWLINE Occurs on initial load and subsequent reloads, but a reflow (forced by resizing NEWLINE the window) causes the "correct" layout to occur. NEWLINE  NEWLINE Problem is dependent on the use of <br> between the images, and on whether the NEWLINE WIDTH and HEIGHT attributes are declared for the top image. NEWLINE  NEWLINE Please see test cases at above URL NEWLINE  NEWLINE Thanks, NEWLINE John
1063|width of form element not right|the drop-down list box with initial value "10" of left side of page is a big too NEWLINE large, pushing the layout of the whole page off a bit
1064|missing vertical space|there should be a little more vertical space between the image "Lycos acquires NEWLINE Wired Digital" and the text just underneath that image. NEWLINE Otherwise, the page looks perfect!

1080|{vmargin} top/bottom block margins and floaters don't mix well|When a block is going to carry-out the top/bottom margins the floaters in it NEWLINE cannot be positioned properly becaues the top/bottom margin value is applied NEWLINE sometime later by some outer block frame.

1082|Mozilla loses default background color after viewing page with javascript|I normally have my background color set to white and my foreground set to black. NEWLINE After I view any page which contains Javascript code, on any page which doesn't NEWLINE specify a background, Mozilla forgets my default background color, and uses the NEWLINE standard gray backgound instead. NEWLINE  NEWLINE Two URLs which show the problem (view in order): NEWLINE <http://www.egroups.com/list/freeqt/> NEWLINE <http://www.cygnus.com/ml/egcs/1998-Oct/> NEWLINE  NEWLINE Selecting "View Source" on the mis-displayed page, closing the source window, NEWLINE and reloading the mis-displayed page makes it (and all subsequently visited NEWLINE pages) display correctly. NEWLINE  NEWLINE This bug has been present in Navigator/Communicator since at least version 3. NEWLINE This bug report is relative to the Mozilla source as pulled down from CVS on NEWLINE 1998-10-09, built as MOZ_MEDIUM. NEWLINE  NEWLINE This is Mozilla for SunOS 5.6, displaying remotely on an 8-bit XFree86 3.3.2 S3 NEWLINE server running on FreeBSD 2.2.7.  (I can test other display setups as well.  It NEWLINE *might* only be a problem with 8-bit displays.)

When the NEWLINE radio button is clicked... there is no event triggered.
1086|Swing Classes repaint problem with JTable & JTree|When clicking into a JTable or JTree, or when trying to scroll it, there is no NEWLINE repaint. After moving the Frame/Applet/Dialog outside of the visual part of the NEWLINE screen, the JTree/JTable is repainted. NEWLINE  NEWLINE How to reproduce : NEWLINE Create a simple Applet/Frame or Dialog using the Swing-Classes V1.0.3. Place a NEWLINE simple JTable/JTree into it. Then start the Applet. Switch back to the Navigator NEWLINE Window and go to a different web-page. Then put the focus back into the applet NEWLINE and try to scroll/select the JTree/JTable. No repaint occurs anymore.
1087|Displays funny|Steve thinks the problem is because the page has floating tables
1088|Necko: Netlib performance ->URLImpl Locking Overhead|Currently URLImpl uses NSPR cached monitors in order to be thread safe. The NEWLINE problem is NSPR cached monitors have a very large performance overhead. NEWLINE  NEWLINE Kipp pointed out that NSPR 2.0 has simple locks, see PR_NewLock() which on NEWLINE Windows are just a critical section. NEWLINE  NEWLINE We should have one NSPR lock for all of the URLImpl objects which makes the NEWLINE resource overhead low
1089|Performance of style= attribute|Peter, Kipp nominated you for fixing this bug. NEWLINE  NEWLINE The basic problem is that the overhead of using a "style" attribute is very NEWLINE high, because the nsGenericHTMLElement code creates a new CSS parser instance NEWLINE for each STYLE attribute. NEWLINE  NEWLINE Each CSSParserImpl object as part of its ParseDeclarations() function creates NEWLINE a new nsString, Unichar input stream, and a CSS scanner which itself has NEWLINE additional overhead
1090|Scrollbar doesn't display|When clicking on a link that contains a fragment identifier (URL that ends NEWLINE with a '#' followed by an anchor identifier) the scrollbar doesn't display. NEWLINE  NEWLINE Go to the URL above and once we scroll to the correct position in the NEWLINE document notice there's no scrollbar displayed. It's there and you can click NEWLINE on the line up button. Resizing the window also causes it to appear
1091|css overflow property and event handling, rendering, clipping|and cursor handling too NEWLINE  NEWLINE we need to determine how to best handle children that are outside their parent NEWLINE for all othe above systems.
1092|window resize causes MARGINWIDTH & HEIGHT settings to be lost|I see that there was an added parameter in the body tag called MARGINWIDTH & NEWLINE HEIGHT.  I don't particularly approve of adding a new parameter myself, but its NEWLINE going to be there for a while I guess. NEWLINE  NEWLINE Anyway, in the URL I gave above, it has the MARGINWIDTH & HEIGHT set to 0 NEWLINE everything's fine and dandy until I maximize the window.  When I do that the NEWLINE MARGINWIDTH & HEIGHT info seems to have disappeared. NEWLINE  NEWLINE My suggested fix for that problem is to eliminate MARGINWIDTH & HEIGHT support NEWLINE actually and support the CSS-1 of setting BODY { padding: 0 }
1093|URLBar: needs watch-cursor status|entering an URL puts up the watch cursor, but only NEWLINE over the HTML area.  cursor should "go watch" NEWLINE over the rest of the chrome too.
1094|FORM behaves like inline element|See the HTML below for an example. NEWLINE  NEWLINE The problem is that FORM is behaving like an inline element rather than NEWLINE a block-level element like the HTML 4 specs indicates (both IE and NEWLINE Navigator handle this correctly). NEWLINE  NEWLINE This may be a problem in the form code, I don't know. NEWLINE  NEWLINE <body> NEWLINE <div style="border:2px blue solid"> NEWLINE This test is to see whether the following form is treated as block-level. NEWLINE <form> NEWLINE <input type="button" value="button"> NEWLINE </form> NEWLINE </div> NEWLINE </body>
1095|colspan with width distorts tables|doesn't display right in raptor because the iframes are used because we do them NEWLINE and they don't layout the same way that IE does them.

NEWLINE  NEWLINE <input type=text size=3 value="123"> NEWLINE  NEWLINE Expected behavior (this is what I see in IE5 and Nav4.5): NEWLINE [123] NEWLINE  NEWLINE Actual behavior: NEWLINE [ 1 ] NEWLINE  NEWLINE There is blank space inside the left and right edges of the input field.
1132|We don't emulate this TEXTAREA quirk|Legacy browsers (IE5, Nav4.5) treat text inside a TEXTAREA like PRE by default, NEWLINE meaning newlines are honored, so: NEWLINE  NEWLINE <textarea> NEWLINE 1 NEWLINE 2 NEWLINE 3 NEWLINE </textarea> NEWLINE  NEWLINE ... will render on 3 seperate lines. NEWLINE  NEWLINE However, all whitespace (including newlines) before the first non-whitespace NEWLINE character is ignored. Which means that these two examples should render NEWLINE identically: NEWLINE  NEWLINE <textarea>1</textarea> NEWLINE <textarea> NEWLINE 1</textarea> NEWLINE  NEWLINE In ngLayout, we render the first newline, which should be ignored.
1133|READONLY attribute not supported|The READONLY attribute applies to text input fields (text and password) and NEWLINE textareas only. NEWLINE  NEWLINE A test case is available at the URL given, at the very bottom of the page. NEWLINE  NEWLINE Behavior of READONLY controls is described in the html 4.0 spec, and they work NEWLINE in ie5 for testing.
1134|DISABLED attribute not supported on OPTION element|The disabled attribute works almost everywhere (terrific!) but not yet on the NEWLINE OPTION element. A test case is available at the URL given. It doesn't work right NEWLINE in ie5b1 either.
1135|DEL and INS need some default style|Currently, these HTML 4.0 elements are not visually rendered in a distinctive NEWLINE fashion. IE 5 uses this style, from what I can tell: NEWLINE  NEWLINE INS { text-decoration: underline; } NEWLINE DEL { text-decoration: strike-through; }
1136|Title of viewer window changes as frames are loaded|As you load Test 9, the title of the viewer window changes as the frames load. NEWLINE The title of the viewer window should be the title of the _top frameset NEWLINE document.
1137|Selection is wrong color|The selection should be the default selection color for the user's environment NEWLINE (the OS tracks this somewhere), not black. NEWLINE  NEWLINE When I make a selection, the background selection color flickers.
1138|HTML 4.0 "Q" (Quotation) tag not implemented yet|The URL given contains a test case for the <Q> tag, which is not implemented yet NEWLINE in NGLayout.
1139|DFN tag needs default style|The DFN tag needs a default style. IE uses (from what I can tell): NEWLINE  NEWLINE DFN { font-style: italic; }
1140|XMP tag not implemented yet|Support for the XML tag has not been fully implemented yet. I remember you two NEWLINE (rickg,kipp) talking about this once, but I forgot the details. NEWLINE  NEWLINE The URL given contains a testcase (at the very bottom).
1141|CSS inherit Value should be supported|The inherit value is very useful for authors to develop stylesheets in cascades NEWLINE where they want to inherit values from the parent element.  I don't think it is NEWLINE quite as important as the universal selector (bug #850), but it is worth NEWLINE implementing. NEWLINE &#137;
1142|Strange Border Bugs|The following test case should show a thin black double border, but instead, NEWLINE only a bottom border is shown: NEWLINE  NEWLINE <style type=text/css> NEWLINE H2 { NEWLINE     border-bottom: thin solid black; NEWLINE   } NEWLINE </style> NEWLINE <body> NEWLINE <h2> NEWLINE Test test test test test NEWLINE </h2> NEWLINE </body> NEWLINE  NEWLINE The following test should show an H1 with a bottom border, followed by an H2 NEWLINE surrounded by a double black border. Instead, the double border around the H2 NEWLINE appears extra thick (on top, outside and bottom, inside lines of the double NEWLINE border): NEWLINE  NEWLINE <style type=text/css> NEWLINE H1 { NEWLINE     border-bottom: thin solid black NEWLINE   } NEWLINE  NEWLINE H2  { NEWLINE     border: double black; NEWLINE   } NEWLINE </style> NEWLINE </head> NEWLINE <body> NEWLINE <h1>test</h1> NEWLINE <h2>test</h2> NEWLINE </body> NEWLINE  NEWLINE If you remove the "thin" from the first border declaration, the problem goes NEWLINE away.
1143|Changing style on anchor in list causes layout glitch|Test case follows. Not sure where this one belongs... The weird behavior is: NEWLINE  NEWLINE 1. When you mouseover a link for the first time, all of the bullets in the NEWLINE unordered list shrink in size slightly. NEWLINE  NEWLINE 2. When you mouseout of a link and change the style of the anchor for the second NEWLINE time, additional "padding" (I don't know if it's really padding) appears around NEWLINE the text NEWLINE  NEWLINE <html> NEWLINE <head> NEWLINE <script> NEWLINE function hotlink(e) { this.style.color="red"; } NEWLINE function dimlink(e) { this.style.color="blue"; } NEWLINE function init() { NEWLINE   var ancs = document.getElementsByTagName("A"); NEWLINE   for (var i=0; i<ancs.length; i++) { NEWLINE     ancs[i].onmouseover=hotlink; NEWLINE     ancs[i].onmouseout=dimlink; NEWLINE   } NEWLINE } NEWLINE </script> NEWLINE <body onload="init()"> NEWLINE <ul> NEWLINE <li><a href="#">Foo</a> NEWLINE <li><a href="#">Foo</a> NEWLINE </ul> NEWLINE </body> NEWLINE </html>
1144|SMART_MAIL=1 needs to be on by default for Win32, Mac|I don't think this is valid in the seamonkey world. Please reopen when it NEWLINE becomes valid again.
1145|Need wrapper script for executable|Since we're shipping .so's now, we should probably NEWLINE include a run-mozilla script that sets LD_LIBRARY_PATH NEWLINE up for the user.  I've created a first version of this NEWLINE (/u/mcafee/xp/nswrap), we should probably rename this NEWLINE to run-mozilla, check it into the xfe tree somewhere, NEWLINE and make this part of make-release.
1146|the DOM memory leak is enourmous...|When using the DOM way of accessing the document, i get _huge_ memory NEWLINE leaks of over 170 megabytes, but when the HTML is something called NEWLINE 'well formed' (XML term), it leaks less, but still it leaks unbelieavably much.
1147|Reflow of PRE text inside tables|There is a problem with reflow of PRE text inside tables, because the size of NEWLINE the table changes when you resize. A good example is viewing a diff using NEWLINE Bonsai.

1150|{inc} extra newlines triggering an extra incremental reflow during doc loading|Because we aren't yet doing a good job of getting rid of all the extra newlines NEWLINE in an HTML document we end up having an extra incremental reflow occur after all NEWLINE of the document has been loaded because the parser takes all the buffered NEWLINE newlines and appends them to the content before finishing. NEWLINE  NEWLINE We need to work out a proper solution to this to avoid the reflow, and to NEWLINE lighten up the total document storage.
1151|We don't honor the "border" attribute on input type=image|Here's a simple test case, taken from a netcenter sign-in page: NEWLINE  NEWLINE <html> NEWLINE <body> NEWLINE <form> NEWLINE <INPUT TYPE=image SRC="http://ureg.netscape.com/images/signin_button.gif" NEWLINE WIDTH=55 HEIGHT=23 BORDER=0> NEWLINE </form> NEWLINE </body> NEWLINE </html> NEWLINE  NEWLINE Currently, we paint the default blue border around the image, despite the NEWLINE "border=0."
1152|Layout: ftp URL's are blank|Marked WONTFIX because NGLayout is going to replace the current layout engine.
1153|nsHTMLReflowState has incorrect percentage min values|The following has two problems (1) The width is constrained relative to the NEWLINE viewer screen, not the DIV and (2) The height is not being constrained at NEWLINE all (the nsHTMLReflowState being passed to the image's Reflow is saying that NEWLINE HaveConstrainedWidth() is false). Substituting other elements for <IMG> gives NEWLINE the same results. NEWLINE  NEWLINE <DIV style="width: 300px; height: 300px; border: 2px solid black;"> NEWLINE <img src=raptor.jpg style="width: 50%; height: 50%;"> NEWLINE </DIV>
1154|body frame not handling constrained widths|nsFieldSetFrame has a body frame. When the nsFieldSetFrame is reflowed with a NEWLINE constrained width, it passes this along to the body's Reflow. However, the body NEWLINE frame is not honoring the minWidth. The example below illustrates this; the NEWLINE images should have been reflowed below one another. I did not try constrained NEWLINE heights. NEWLINE  NEWLINE <body> NEWLINE <FORM> NEWLINE <fieldset style="display: inline; width: 75px; height: 200px"> NEWLINE <legend>hello</legend> NEWLINE <img src=raptor.jpg style="width:50px; height:50px;"> NEWLINE <img src=raptor.jpg style="width:50px; height:50px;"> NEWLINE </fieldset> NEWLINE </form> NEWLINE </body>
1155|OBJECTs do not degrade correctly|OBJECTs with unknown MIME types do not degrade correctly NEWLINE - i.e. the content of the OBJECT element is not displayed. NEWLINE For example: NEWLINE  NEWLINE <object type="video/mpeg" data="test.mpg"> NEWLINE   alternative text NEWLINE </object> NEWLINE  NEWLINE The words "alternative text" should be rendered, if NGLayout NEWLINE cannot find a plugin for video/mpeg. Currently, they are not.
1156|OBJECTs without type attribute aren't rendered|OBJECTs without the *optional* type attribute are not NEWLINE rendered at all, even when the file format is a familiar NEWLINE one.  They don't degrade correctly, either. NEWLINE  NEWLINE Example: NEWLINE  NEWLINE <object data="test.avi"> NEWLINE   alternative text NEWLINE </object> NEWLINE  NEWLINE Either the test.avi video or the words "alternative text" should be rendered. NEWLINE Currently, nothing is displayed.
1157|AVI and WAV OBJECTs crash again|(Note: I ran these tests with both the plugins from NEWLINE Navigator 4.5 PR2 and the old versions from Navigator 3.0. NEWLINE I changed the plugins by modifying the registry at NEWLINE "hkey_current_user/software/netscape/netscape NEWLINE navigator/main/install directory".) NEWLINE  NEWLINE Trouble with AVI and WAV OBJECTs.  The following NEWLINE problems occurred on any OBJECT with the MIME type NEWLINE "video/x-msvideo" or "audio/wav". NEWLINE  NEWLINE The plugin gets loaded, but the video/audio clip won't play. NEWLINE  NEWLINE When using the plugins from 4.5 PR2, the AVI object is just NEWLINE an empty space where the previous page shows through. NEWLINE Clicking right button on the space gives a NPAVI32 menu, but NEWLINE selecting "Play" or anything else does nothing.  When I use NEWLINE the plugins from Nav3.0, NGLayout crashes immediately on NEWLINE loading the page! NEWLINE  NEWLINE In the WAV tests, a LiveAudio plugin panel saying "Loading NEWLINE audio file..." is shown.  Clicking on the panel a few times NEWLINE causes a crash.  The behaviour is identical with both plugin NEWLINE versions. NEWLINE  NEWLINE Here's a sample output from my NGLayout on a WAV object test: NEWLINE  NEWLINE   loaded plugin npaudio.dll for mime type audio/wav NEWLINE   result of creating plugin adapter: 0 NEWLINE   successfully created plugin instance 01253dd0 for NEWLINE     npaudio.dll, mimetype audio/wav NEWLINE   instance start called NEWLINE  NEWLINE The output is similar in the AVI tests.
1158|OBJECTs in natively supported formats aren't rendered at all|GIF, JPEG, PNG, HTML and plain text OBJECTs are not NEWLINE displayed - even though NGLayout is able to display inline NEWLINE images in those 3 formats, and IFRAMEs in HTML or plain NEWLINE text.  NGLayout says that it's "unable to find plugin to NEWLINE handle [the MIME type in question]".  It shouldn't really NEWLINE need to look for plugins when it can handle the object NEWLINE natively. NEWLINE  NEWLINE Example: NEWLINE  NEWLINE <object type="image/gif" data="test.gif"> NEWLINE   alternative text NEWLINE </object> NEWLINE  NEWLINE Either a GIF image or "alternative text" should be displayed.  Currently, NEWLINE there's just a grey box.

1162|Scrollbars never appear if you load this URL|Try loading that URL into the Raptor test viewer. I imagine this occurs on other NEWLINE pages where the anchor leads you somewhere "below the fold." The vertical NEWLINE scrollbar never appears, although you can scroll via selection or pgdn/pgup key NEWLINE presses.
